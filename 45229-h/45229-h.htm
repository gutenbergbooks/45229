<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N every department of science the theories of yesterday
are perpetually being displaced by the empirical
facts of to-day, though the ascertainment of these facts
is frequently the indirect outcome of the theories which
the facts themselves dissipate. Hence it is that the works
of the greatest scholars and experts have no finality, they
are but stepping-stones towards the goal of perfect knowledge.
Since the publications of Layard, Rawlinson,
Botta and Place much new material has been made accessible
for the reconstruction of the historic past of the
Babylonians and Assyrians, and we are consequently able
to fill in many gaps in the picture so admirably, and as
far as it went, so faithfully drawn by the pioneers in the
field of excavation and research. This work, which owes
its origin to a suggestion made by Dr. Wallis Budge,
represents an endeavour on the part of the writer to give
a brief account of the civilization of ancient Babylonia
and Assyria in the light of this new material.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the infinitude of activities and pursuits
which go to make up the civilization of any country
will justify the writer&#8217;s treatment of so many subjects in
a single volume. It will be observed that space allotted
to the consideration of the different arts and crafts varies
on the one hand according to the relative importance of
the part each played in the life of the people, and on the
other hand according to the amount of material available
for the study of the particular subject.</p>

<p>No effort has been spared to make the chapters on
Architecture, Sculpture and Metallurgy as comprehensive
as the limitations of the volume permit, while for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">Pg viii</a></span>
the sake of those who desire to pursue the study of any of
the subjects dealt with in this book, and to work up the
sketch into a picture, a short bibliography is given at
the end.</p>

<p>It has not been thought desirable to amass a vast number
of references in the footnotes, and the writer is thereby
debarred from acknowledging his indebtedness to the
works of other writers on all occasions as he would like
to have done.</p>

<p>In addition to the chapters which deal expressly with
the cultural evolution of the dwellers in Mesopotamia,
two chapters are devoted to the consideration of the
Cuneiform writing&#8212;its pictorial origin, the history of
its decipherment, and the literature of which it is the
vehicle, while another chapter is occupied with a historical
review of the excavations. The short chronological
summary at the end obviously makes not the slightest
pretension to even being a comprehensive summary; it
merely purports to give the general chronological order
of some of the better known rulers and kings of Babylonia
and Assyria to whom allusion is made in this
volume, together with a notice of some of the more significant
land-marks in the history of the two countries.</p>

<p>The writer&#8217;s thanks are due to the Trustees of the
British Museum for permission to photograph some of
the objects in the Babylonian and Assyrian Collections,
and to Dr. Wallis Budge for facilities and encouragement
in carrying out the work; to the University of
Chicago Press for allowing him to reproduce illustrations
from the <i>American Journal of Semitic Languages</i> and
also diagrams from Harper&#8217;s Memorial Volumes; to
M. Ernest Leroux for permitting him to make use of
some of the plates contained in the monumental works
of De Sarzec and Heuzey, and to M. Ch. Eggimann of
the &#8220;Libraire Centrale d&#8217;art et d&#8217;architecture ancienne
maison Morel,&#8221; for his very kind permission to reproduce
two of the plates contained in Dieulafoy, <i>L&#8217;Art</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">Pg ix</a></span>
<i>Antique de la Perse</i>. He is similarly indebted to the
Deutsche-Orient Gesellschaft for allowing him to make
an autotype copy of one of the plates in Andrae&#8217;s <i>Der
Anu-Adad Tempel</i>. He further desires to acknowledge
the generosity of Prof. H. V. Hilprecht in allowing him
to make use of many of the illustrations contained in
his numerous publications, and also of Dr. Fisher for
permitting him to reproduce some of the photographs
contained in his magnificently illustrated work on the
excavations at Nippur. He is very sensible of his indebtedness
to these two gentlemen, as also to M. Leroux
and the Deutsche-Orient Gesellschaft, for the photographs
of excavations in progress are obviously of
a unique character and admit of no repetition; he
further desires to express his obligations to Dr. W.
Hayes Ward for his most kind permission to copy a
number of seal-impressions and other illustrations contained
in his recently published work&#8212;<i>Cylinder-Seals of
Western Asia</i>. Lastly, he welcomes the opportunity of
acknowledging the kindness of Mr. Mansell for allowing
him to publish many photographs of objects in the
British Museum and the Louvre contained in his incomparable
collection, and for in other ways facilitating the
illustration of this volume. Most of the plans and
drawings used for this volume are the work of Miss
E. K. Reader, who has performed her task with her
usual skill.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I&#8212;INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>(<i>a</i>) LAND AND PEOPLE</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Mesopotamian civilization shares with the
Egyptian civilization the honour of being one of
the two earliest civilizations in the world, and although
M. J. de Morgan&#8217;s excavations at Susa the ruined capital
of ancient Elam, have brought to light the elements of
an advanced civilization which perhaps even antedates
that of Mesopotamia, it must be remembered that the
Sumerians who, so far as our present knowledge goes,
were the first to introduce the arts of life and all that they
bring with them, into the low-lying valley of the Tigris
and Euphrates, probably themselves emigrated from the
Elamite plateau on the east of the Tigris; at all events
the Sumerians expressed both &#8220;mountain&#8221; and &#8220;country&#8221;
by the same writing-sign, the two apparently being
synonymous from their point of view; in support
of this theory of a mountain-home for the Sumerians,
we may perhaps further explain the temple-towers, the
characteristic feature of most of the religious edifices in
Mesopotamia, as a conscious or unconscious imitation in
bricks and mortar of the hills and ridges of their native-land,
due to an innate aversion to the dead-level monotony
of the Babylonian plain, while it is also a significant
fact that in the earliest period Shamash the Sun-god
is represented with one foot resting on a mountain,
<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 2</span>
or else standing between two mountains. However
this may be, the history of the Elamites was intimately
wrapped up with that of the dwellers on the other side of
the Tigris, from the earliest times down to the sack of
Susa by Ashur-bani-pal, king of Assyria, in the seventh
century. Both peoples adopted the cuneiform system
of writing, so-called owing to the wedge-shaped formation
of the characters, the wedges being due to the
material used in later times for all writing purposes&#8212;the
clay of their native soil&#8212;: both spoke an agglutinative,
as opposed to an inflexional language like our
own, and both inherited a similar culture.</p>

<p>A further, and in its way a more convincing argument
in support of the mountain-origin theory is afforded
by the early art of the Sumerians. On the most
primitive seal cylinders<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> we find trees and animals
whose home is in the mountains, and which certainly
were not native to the low-lying plain of Babylonia.
The cypress and the cedar-tree are only found in mountainous
districts, but a tree which must be identified
with one or the other of them is represented on the
early seal cylinders; it is of course true that ancient
Sumerian rulers fetched cedar wood from the mountains
for their building operations, and therefore the presence
of such a tree on cylinder seals merely argues a certain
acquaintance with the tree, but <i>Ceteris paribus</i> it is more
reasonable to suppose that the material earthly objects
depicted, were those with which the people were entirely
familiar and not those with which they were merely
casually acquainted. Again, on the early cylinders the
mountain bull, known as the <i>Bison bonasus</i>, assumes the
rôle played in later times by the lowland water-buffalo.
This occurs with such persistent regularity that the
inference that the home of the Sumerians in those days
was in the mountains is almost inevitable. Again, as
Ward points out, the composite man-bull Ea-bani, the
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 3</span>
companion of Gilgamesh, has always the body of a bison,
never that of a buffalo. So too the frequent occurrence
of the ibex, the oryx, and the deer with branching
horns, all argues in the same direction, for the natural
home of all these animals lay in the mountains.</p>

<p>The Mesopotamian valley may, for the immediate
purpose of this book, be divided into two halves, a
dividing-line being roughly drawn between the two
rivers just above Abû Habba (Sippar); the northern
half embraces the land occupied by the Assyrians, and
the southern half that occupied by the Babylonians.
The precise date at which Assyria was colonized by
Babylonia is not known, but to the first known native<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
king of Assyria, Irishum, we may assign an approximate
date of 2000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> Babylonia proper is an alluvial
plain the limits of which on the east and west are the
mountains of Persia and the table-land of Arabia respectively.
This valley has been gradually formed at
the expense of the sea&#8217;s domain, for in the remote past
the Persian Gulf swept over the whole plain at least as
far northward as the city of Babylon where sea-shells
have been found, and probably a good deal further. It
owes its formation to the silt brought down by the two
rivers and deposited at the mouth of the Gulf: the
amount of land thus yearly reclaimed from the sea in
early times is not known, but as Spasinus Chorax the
modern Mohammerah, which is now some forty-seven
miles inland, was situated on the sea-coast in the time of
Alexander, we know that the conquest of the land over
the sea has been progressing since his time at the rate
of 115 feet yearly.</p>

<p>Thus the physical characteristics of the country in
which Babylonian civilization was developed, if it was
not actually the place of its origin, form a close
parallel to those of Lower Egypt; in Egypt however
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 4</span>such evidence as there is, would indicate the South, or
Upper Egypt as the earliest scene of civilization, the
North being conquered by the Mesniu (Metal-users)
of the South, not only in the battle-field but also in culture
and civilization. Both countries have but a small
sea-board where their rivers find an outlet, the Nile into
the Mediterranean, and the Tigris and Euphrates
into the Persian Gulf; both countries had emerged
and were yearly emerging out of the sea, for it is certain
that at one time the Mediterranean penetrated as
far south as Esneh, while as already mentioned, the
Persian Gulf extended at least as far as Babylon; we
are accordingly not surprised to find in both the Babylonian
and Egyptian cosmologies a tradition which told
of the creation of the world out of a primæval mass
of water, though this idea looms less conspicuously in
the Egyptian than in the Babylonian and Hebrew cosmologies.
Both countries also were visited by a yearly
inundation which, while it brought no small amount of
devastation in its train, at the same time deposited the
mud so essential to the enrichment of the soil, the
desolation being checked or at least mitigated in either
country by an elaborate system of irrigation canals, which
same canals were in the summer-time the means of conveying
the life-giving water to the dry and thirsty land.
Both Babylonia and Egypt enjoy a warm climate, though
Egypt is much more dry and therefore healthier, and
the corresponding dryness of its soil has preserved the
tangible evidences of its ancient history in a far more
perfect condition than the marsh-country of Lower
Mesopotamia; and lastly the climate of Egypt is not
subject to the same violent changes of temperature incidental
to the seasons in the Valley of the Euphrates.</p>

<p>The evidence of any racial connection between the
earliest known inhabitants of the two countries is very
precarious; as regards their art, their customs and their
language, the Sumerians on the one hand, and the pre-dynastic
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 5</span>and early dynastic Egyptians on the other, show
a complete independence of each other; both countries
were probably invaded at an early period of their histories
by the Semites, who in the case of Mesopotamia
completely supplanted their predecessors of different
stock, but who were at the same time themselves absorbed
by the higher civilization of the Sumerians to
which they were the destined heirs, and to the further
development of which they themselves were to contribute
so largely; but at what period or periods the
Semites swept over Egypt and the north coast of Africa,
impressing their indelible and unmistakable stamp upon
the foundation-structure of the Egyptian and Libyan
languages is not known; whenever it was, we can safely
assume that their advent took place in prehistoric days,
for the hieroglyphs and probably also the language
of the dynastic Egyptians were the natural development
of the language and crude picture-signs of their
predecessors, and the theory of a violent break in the
continuity of early Egyptian civilization at the commencement
of the first dynasty is daily becoming
more untenable. We are similarly unable to assign any
definite date to the arrival of the Semites in the Mesopotamian
Valley, though the Neo-Babylonian King Nabonidus
gives us a traditional date for Shar-Gâni-sharri<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
(Sargon) and his son Narâm-Sin, kings of Agade, who,
so far as we know, established the first Semitic empire
in the country. There were indeed Semitic Kings
of Kish before the time of Shar-Gâni-sharri, but the extent
of their sway was clearly very limited compared
with the far-reaching empire of the rulers of Agade.
But there are reasons for doubting the accuracy of the
traditional date of 3750 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> which Nabonidus assigns
to Narâm-Sin, the chief reason being the extraordinary
gap in the yieldings of Babylonian excavations between
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 6</span>the time of Shar-Gâni-sharri and Narâm-Sin, and that of
Gudea, the priest-king of Lagash in Southern Babylonia,
who reigned about 2400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>; that is to say, concerning a
period of about 1300 years the excavations have afforded
us practically no information whatever, while both at
the beginning and at the close of that period, we have
abundant evidence of the civilization and history of the
inhabitants of Babylonia; secondly, the style of art characteristic
of the time of Gudea and the kings of Ur, as
also the style of writing found in their inscriptions,
presuppose no such long interval between the time of
Sargon and their own day. But there are yet other considerations
which are even more potent, and which deserve
greater attention than has been up to the present
accorded to them, depending as they do upon the stratification
of the ruined mounds themselves. Now it is a
very significant fact that the architectural remains of
Ur-Engur (<i>circ.</i> 2400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) at Nippur, are found immediately
above those of Narâm-Sin, for such an arrangement
is hardly conceivable if a period of some thirteen
hundred years separated these two rulers. Again, the
excavations carried on by Dr. Banks for the University
of Chicago at Bismâya have been productive of similar
evidence, for immediately below the ruined ziggurat of
Dungi, Ur-Engur&#8217;s successor on the throne of Ur, large
square bricks of the size and shape characteristic of the
time of Shar-Gâni-sharri were discovered, while among
the bricks a strip of gold inscribed with the name of
Narâm-Sin was also brought to light. The evidence
afforded by the excavations on these two sites would
thus appear to be exceedingly strong against the traditional
date recorded by Nabonidus.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>It is therefore tempting to reason that that long silent
period, the silence of which cannot be adequately accounted
for, had no existence at all, that Nabonidus&#8217;
statement is therefore to be discredited, and that Shar-Gâni-sharri
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 7</span>and Narâm-Sin probably lived and reigned
more than a thousand years later, i.e. about 2650 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
On the other hand it is important to remember that the
Babylonians were astronomers and mathematicians of no
mean order, and that they exercised the greatest possible
care in calculating dates, that moreover Nabonidus was
a king of Babylonia, and therefore &#8220;a priori&#8221; likely to
be in possession of reliable traditions, if any existed, and
further, that he lived 2500 years nearer to the time than
we do. The inscription of Nabonidus in question was
found in the mound of Sippar near Agade. It says:&#8212;&#8220;The
foundation corner-stone of the temple E-ulba in
the town of the eternal fire (Agade) had not been seen
since the times before Sargon King of Babylonia and his
son Narâm-Sin.... The cylinder of Narâm-Sin, son
of Sargon, whom for 3200 years, no king among his predecessors
had seen, Shamash the great lord of Sippara
hath revealed to him.&#8221; Thus according to Nabonidus,
Narâm-Sin lived about 3750 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> The archæological
evidence is however so strong in this particular case,
both negatively in regard to the absence of any tangible
evidence of the long interval in question, and positively
in regard to the stratification of the mounds containing
the relics of these two kings and also in regard to the
similarity between the earlier sculptures and inscriptions
of Shar-Gâni-sharri and Narâm-Sin and those belonging
to the latter half of the third millennium <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, that we are
no longer able to maintain the implicit confidence in the
historical accuracy of Nabonidus which early scholars
once had.</p>

<p>From the inscriptions of Shar-Gâni-sharri and Narâm-Sin
that have been brought to light, we gather that
the authors of these inscriptions were Semites, in
other words we learn that the empire of Agade was a
Semitic Empire, and since they extended their empire
over all Western Asia, the Sumerian power located more
in the south must have proportionately dwindled. But
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 8</span>their Sumerian predecessors had established their influence
and power in Mesopotamia for a long and indefinite
time before this date, for Sumerian inscriptions which
are almost certainly to be assigned to the pre-Sargonic
period give us the names of a large number of early
kings and rulers of Babylonia; their early date is shown
by the writing of these inscriptions which bear a more
archaic stamp than those of Shar-Gâni-sharri and Narâm-Sin.
For just as uninscribed sculptures are relatively
dateable by the style of art to which they conform, so
that it is possible to provisionally say that this sculpture
or cylinder-seal is older than that, because it presents a
more archaic and less finished style of art, so is it possible
to approximately date un-named and un-dated inscriptions
by the style of writing adopted in those inscriptions.
We thus have two means at our disposal by which we
can assign uninscribed monuments of an early period to
their relatively correct places in the evolution of art and
culture; on the one hand the stratum of the ruined
mound in which the object in question has been found
can often itself be relatively dated by actually inscribed
monuments found either in the stratum itself, or in the
stratum immediately above or below; or failing these,
by the depth at which the stratum lies below the top of
the mound, though this latter alone is a poor criterion
owing to the fact that such accumulation will obviously
vary in different places. The value of all such evidence
however depends on whether or not the strata have
been disturbed, as is often unfortunately the case.</p>

<p>The reason why the ruins of Mesopotamian cities
have assumed the form of mounds lies in the fact that a
conquering chief demolished the clay walls and buildings
of his vanquished foe, but instead of clearing the débris
away, he built on the top of it; for his new building
operations the new-comer often utilized part of the old
material, hence the uncertainty of a date assigned to an
object, based on the mere assumption that such object
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 9</span>belongs to the stratum in which it has ultimately found
itself, without other corroborative evidence. On the
other hand we are in these days always able to apply the
purely archæological test, which depends upon a close
examination of the style of art or the mode of writing.</p>

<p>Some of these pre-Sargonic rulers already alluded to
can be arranged in strictly chronological order, i.e. the
rulers of the city of Lagash, one of the earliest centres
of Sumerian civilization in Babylonia. Lagash lies fifteen
hours&#8217; journey north of Ur and two hours&#8217; east of
Warka (the ancient Erech), and it is Lagash which has
provided us with more material for our study of early
Sumerian life and culture than any other city in the
Euphrates valley.</p>

<p>The order of the early pre-Sargonic rulers of Lagash
is as follows: Ur-Ninâ, apparently the founder of the
dynasty, inasmuch as he bestows no royal title on his
father or grandfather, and his successors traced themselves
back to him; Akurgal, Eannatum, Enannatum I,
Entemena, Enannatum II, Enetarzi, Enlitarzi, Lugal-anda,
and Urukagina. But though their chronological
order is certain, the length of their reigns is unknown,
and their dates can only be approximately ascertained,
and even these approximate and relative dates depend
entirely on the date of Shar-Gâni-sharri. Assuming the
latter&#8217;s date to have been about 2650 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, Ur-Ninâ&#8217;s
date would be roughly about 3000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> Ur-Ninâ the
first member of the dynasty has left us a number of his
sculptures and stelæ, but there are other nameless works
of art discovered either in the neighbourhood or actually
in Lagash itself which present a less developed form of
art, and where inscriptions are concerned, a more archaic
style of writing, while in certain cases the monuments in
question were actually discovered in the strata underneath
the building of Ur-Ninâ, and with these the history
of Mesopotamian art and of the civilization to which it
bears such eloquent testimony commences.</p>

<p><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 10</span></p>

<h4>RACE</h4>

<p>The race to which the Sumerians belonged is not known,
but the fact that their language being agglutinative and
not inflexional, was therefore neither Aryan nor Semitic,
but at least and in this respect akin to the Mongolian languages,
of which Turkish, Finnish, Chinese and Japanese
are the most illustrious examples to-day, has led certain
scholars to seek a connection between some of the
Sumerian roots and certain Chinese words, it must however
be admitted that this supposed connection is rather
hypothetical at present. Further efforts have also been
made by Lacouperie and others to establish parallels between
Chinese art and culture and those of the Sumerians,
but the evidence is not very convincing.</p>

<h4>SOIL</h4>

<p>As the surface-soil of Babylonia did not originate
there, but was brought down by the rivers and deposited
by them as their currents lost impetus in approaching the
sea, and were thus unable to carry their burden further,
it is well to trace this soil to its original source. Both the
Euphrates and the Tigris rise in the mountains of
Armenia,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> the geological formation of which is chiefly
granite, gneiss and other feldspathic rocks. These rocks
were gradually decomposed by the rains, their detritus
being hurried rapidly down-stream; the rivers in the
course of their career travel through a variety of geological
formations including limestone, sandstone and
quartz, all of which contribute something to the silt
which is destined to form part of the delta&#8217;s soil; the
latter being composed mainly of chalk, sand, and clay, is
extremely fertile, which won for it a reputation testified
to even by the classical writers: thus Herodotus who
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 11</span>flourished in the seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> tells us (I, 293)
that &#8220;of all the countries that we know, there is none
which is so fruitful in grain. It makes no pretension indeed,
of growing the olive, the vine, or any other trees
of the kind; but in grain it is so fruitful as to yield commonly
two hundredfold, and when the production is
greatest even three hundredfold. The blade of the wheat-plant
and barley is often four fingers in breadth. As for
millet and the sesame, I shall not say to what height they
grow, though within my own knowledge, for I am not
ignorant that what I have already written concerning the
fruitfulness of Babylonia, must seem incredible to those
who have never visited the country.... Palm trees
grow in great numbers over the whole of the flat country,
mostly of the kind that bears fruit, and this fruit supplies
them with bread, wine and honey.&#8221; However exaggerated
this account may be, all ancient writers agree in
ascribing to Babylonian soil a fertility and productivity
surpassing that of any other country with which they
were acquainted.</p>

<p>But the present state of the country is very different
from what it was, neglect of cultivation having reduced
it once more to a desert waste, or, in the immediate
neighbourhood of the rivers, to a pestiferous
marsh. The rivers have furthermore varied their courses
time and again, though this remark applies more to the
sluggish stream of the Euphrates with its low banks,
than to the more swiftly flowing Tigris whose current is
confined by higher banks, and whose course has consequently
undergone less change. At the present time,
great efforts are being made to make amends for the
neglect to which the once fertile plain of Babylonia has so
long been subject, and in the early part of last year (1911)
the firm of Sir John Jackson (Limited), contractors and
engineers, secured the contract for the building of a great
dam at the head of the Hindiyah Canal: this latter is a
channel for which the Euphrates has forsaken its own
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 12</span>bed, and consequently the Euphrates&#8217; bed upon whose
banks the city of Babylon lies, is in summer-time perfectly
dry, all the water flowing down the Hindiyah
Canal except at the time of the inundation. Thus it is
that the population have practically ceased to attempt the
cultivation of the Euphrates&#8217; banks, and have for the
most part migrated across country to this canal. The
latter however, being quite inadequate for the burden
thus thrust upon it by the undivided waters of the Euphrates,
has become badly water-logged, and much good
land has become swamp. The Turks have been endeavouring
for a long time to erect a dam which would drive
back part of the water into the bed of the river, and thus
at the same time make the regulation of the flow in the
canal a possibility, but they have not attained their object.
The engineers of Sir William Willcocks were successful
in filling up the space between the two arms of the barrage,
but the dam was almost immediately breached at
another point. When however the scheme now in hand
is duly realized, the banks of the Euphrates will once
again be dotted with the fertility of bygone days, while
the district dependent for its prosperity upon the conditions
of the Hindiyah Canal will be similarly improved.</p>

<p>By the side of these rivers flourished the acacia, the
pomegranate and the poplar, but the tree which stood the
Babylonians in best stead, was the date-palm, from the
sap of which they made sugar and also a fermented liquor,
while its fibrous barks served for ropes, and its wood,
being at the same time light and strong, was extensively
used as a building material. So many and so divers were
the uses which the date-palm served, that the Babylonians
had a popular song<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> in which they celebrated the three
hundred and sixty benefits of this invaluable tree. The
important part which it played in the life of the early
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 13</span>Sumerian population is indicated by the epithet applied
by Entemena to the goddess Ninâ, whom he addresses as
the lady &#8220;who makes the dates grow,&#8221; while various
amphora-shaped vats, and also a kind of oval basin evidently
used in the manufacture or preservation of date-wine
were discovered by De Sarzec at Tellô.</p>

<p>The date-tree finds a place on the Assyrian bas-reliefs,
but it must be confessed that the artistic products of the
Babylonians and Assyrians do not afford us so much information
as might be expected regarding the flora and
fauna of the country. Vines and palms are of frequent
occurrence on the later bas-reliefs, while oaks and terebinths
were also known, for Esarhaddon uses them as
material in his building operations at Babylon, and cedar
trees were regularly procured for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Of the various trees represented on early seals, hardly
any can be identified with any degree of certainty, the
date-palm perhaps being excepted: the reed of the
marshes appears fairly soon, but the fig-tree on the
other hand occurs only in later times, which accords
with Herodotus&#8217; intimation that they were not grown
in Mesopotamia in his day; this notwithstanding, they
must have been known and presumably cultivated
sufficiently early, for amongst the offerings made by
Gudea (2450 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) to the goddess Bau, figs are enumerated,
while the olive-tree must also have been known
at an early date, for objects in clay in the form of an
olive belonging to the time of Urukagina are still extant.</p>

<p>The Lotus is sometimes engraved on a seal, always
in the hand of a god, and with other Egyptian elements
it is frequently found on the ivories and bronze dishes
from Nimrûd.</p>

<p>Millet and other cereals have been the subject of
artistic delineation; flowers of a nondescript character
appear in later times, though the conventional designs
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 14</span>of the rosettes, so familiar in Assyrian art, an example
of which is to be found in Pl. <a href="#pXXX">XXX</a>, without doubt
owed its origin to an actual attempt to reproduce a living
flower, while ivy only occurs on a late Græco-Egyptian
cylinder, and on a Syro-Hittite cylinder we find a representation
of the thistle.</p>

<p>Reeds are found more often than any other tree or
plant, alike on cylinder-seals and bas-reliefs. They were
in great demand for the construction of huts and light
boats, but the clay of their native soil furnished an all-availing
and all-abundant material for the building operations
of their palaces, temples and houses; its possibilities
were recognized at a very early date, and were made
use of accordingly. Stone is practically unknown in the
low-lying plain of Babylonia,and when required, it had to
be quarried far away in the mountains and transported
at great cost and labour, hence it was comparatively
seldom used for artistic or decorative effects pure and
simple, but was rather employed where the desire for
durability rendered it necessary; for this reason the
stone used in Babylonia is generally basalt, diorite,
dolerite or some other hard stone of volcanic origin.
In Assyria on the other hand, both alabaster and various
kinds of limestone were easily procurable, and were
used largely for building purposes, while they both,
also, adapted themselves readily to the chisel of the
sculptor whose duty it was to record the chief events
of the king&#8217;s reign in pictorial form upon the walls of
his palace.</p>

<p>Of the cereals, wheat, barley, vetches and millet were
the most important, and they all grew in large quantities,
while as regards domestic animals&#8212;horses, oxen,
sheep, pigs, goats, asses and dogs were the most familiar;
upon the bas-reliefs from Kouyunjik, one of the mounds
representing the ancient Nineveh (the other being Nebi
Yûnus (&#8220;Prophet Jonah&#8221;), so-called by the natives,
owing to their belief that the prophet Jonah was buried
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 15</span>there), camels are to be found, while they also form part
of the tribute brought by tributary princes to Shalmaneser
II King of Assyria 860-825 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and are represented
accordingly on the bronze gates from Balâwât
and on the so-called Black Obelisk, principally famous
for its representation of Jehu and his tribute-bearers.
The camels represented here belong to the double-humped
Bactrian breed, which have less staying-power
than the single-humped dromedaries of Arabia and
Africa. In Babylonia at the present day, these last-named
are a most important means of locomotion, but
in the hilly country of Assyria, they are of less use,
owing to their tendency to slip on any but the flattest
of grounds. There is apparently only one isolated
occurrence of a camel on a cylinder-seal, and that belongs
to the Persian period. The Assyrian word used
for &#8220;camel&#8221; is probably of Arabic origin, and Arabia
was doubtless the home of the camel. As for horses,
oxen, sheep, goats and dogs, they are constantly represented
in Assyrian art. The horse being native to Asia,
was in all probability domesticated in Mesopotamia
earlier than in Egypt; very early evidence of its existence
in Mesopotamia was thought to be afforded by an
archaic seal-cylinder, now in the Metropolitan Museum
of New York, in which a god is represented driving a
four-wheeled chariot, in contrast to the Assyrian war-chariots
which were two-wheeled; the chariot is drawn
by an animal of uncertain character, which Ward originally
regarded as a horse, but in view of a representation
of a bull drawing a chariot, found on an early
Assyrian seal which he dates about 2000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, it is
clear that the bull was used to draw chariots in early
times, and Ward accordingly regards the ambiguous
animal alluded to, as also a bull. The Sumerian name
for the horse was &#8220;the ass of the mountains,&#8221; an indication
that the animal was first known to them in its
wild state: we find it figured on one of Nebuchadnezzar
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 16</span>I&#8217;s boundary stone (<i>circ.</i> 1120 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), but it was
certainly known in the valley much earlier. The Hyksos,
or shepherd-kings from Asia introduced the horse
into Egypt about 1700 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, while mention is made of
horses in a letter from Burraburiash the king of Babylon
to Amen&#7717;etep, king of Egypt about 1400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>An extremely early fragment from Nippur (cf. Fig.
<a href="#fig25">25</a>, E) published by Hilprecht and quoted and reproduced
by Ward,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> shows us a horned animal dragging a plough,
which Ward thinks may be a gazelle or an antelope;
if the latter be the case, we may perhaps infer that an
animal of that species was used for draft purposes before
the bull, and certainly before the horse. However
that may be, in later days the horse seems to have been
reserved for the battle-field and the chase. The Assyrian
soldiers both rode them and harnessed them to their
war-chariots, and it is worth noticing how much more
successful the Assyrian sculptors were in their representations
of the horse than the Egyptians. The
horses on the bas-reliefs apparently belong to a smaller,
shorter and more thick-set breed than Arabs, and the
breed is still supposed to be extant in Kurdistan. The
Assyrians do not seem to have been in the habit of endowing
the horse with wings or with a human head, as
they sometimes did the bull and the lion, though some
of the Pehlevi<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> seals and rings of later days (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 226-632)
show figures of winged horses.</p>

<p>The <i>Ox</i> with &#8220;long upright and bent horns&#8221; seems
to have been domesticated from the very earliest period,
and it is represented on cylinder-seals which by their
inscriptions show that they belong to the early period
when the line-writing had not as yet been supplanted by
its later off-shoot cuneiform, while on one of these early
seals (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig63">63</a>) the god himself is depicted riding on
one of these bulls; it is however to be observed that the
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 17</span>bull plays a less conspicuous part in the artistic representations
of Mesopotamia than in those of Egypt, where
the tombs so often exhibit the daily scenes of agricultural
life. Only very rarely is the bull represented on cylinder-seals
or sculptures as a sacrificial victim, the best example
being afforded by a fragment of the Vulture Stele
of Eannatum; the same king informs us elsewhere that
he sacrificed bulls to the sun-god in Larsa, and a bull-calf
to En-lil, the lord of Nippur, who is better known
under the Semitic name of Bêl, a name which however
he never bore;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> if however the bull were used but seldom
in sacrificial worship, there is no doubt that he was regarded
throughout Mesopotamian history as the embodiment
of, and therefore the natural symbol for
strength and fertility, while the winged bulls of Sargon
(cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXV">XXV</a>) are the most familiar and perhaps the most
characteristic monuments of Assyrian art.</p>

<p>The <i>Mule</i> was used as a beast of burden; carts were
drawn by mules, and women and children were borne by
them, while they were used for carrying merchandise,
and for menial work of every kind; they are occasionally
seen on Assyrian bas-reliefs and form one of the
subjects of Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s famous Hunting Scenes,
where they are in charge of the king&#8217;s servants.</p>

<p>The <i>Sheep</i> was domesticated from the earliest times,
but representations of the goat are more common; in
Fig. <a href="#fig62">62</a> we have an extremely archaic seal on which a
man is seen driving a goat followed by two sheep. A
further example of the goat and sheep is found on the
early stone relief seen in Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, F.</p>

<p>The <i>Goat</i> is of frequent occurrence both on seals and
also in bas-reliefs. The goat was, as far as we can tell,
the most commonly used sacrificial victim, the worshipper
often being represented as bringing a goat in his
arms. (For an early example of a goat in Babylonian
art, cf. the copper goat&#8217;s head from Fâra, <a href="#fig40">40</a>, B.) Fig.
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 18</span>The beard is sometimes clearly delineated,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> thereby
showing it to be a goat and not an antelope, while
both the sheep and goat are well represented on the
bronze gate-sheaths from Balâwât. Though the sheep
however does not appear to have assumed so important
a part as the goat in sacrificial worship, it played a far
more conspicuous rôle in augury, and innumerable omens
were deduced from an inspection of the various parts of
its liver.</p>

<p>The <i>Ass</i> was known from the earliest period, both the
wild ass, which Ashur-bani-pal seems to have been so
fond of hunting (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXa">XX</a>), and also the domesticated
ass. Ward has only found one example of its early representation
on cylinder-seals, but the god Nin-girsu&#8217;s
chariot on the famous Vulture Stele is drawn by an ass,
and the fact that Urukagina, one of the kings of the
First Dynasty of Lagash, enacted that if a good ass was
foaled in the stable of one of the king&#8217;s subjects, the
king could only purchase it by offering a fair price,
and that even then he could not compel the owner to
part with it, shows that the ass was in common use in
his day.</p>

<p>The <i>Dog</i> finds a place on some of the earliest seals
from Babylonia, and is especially common on those representing
the legend of Etana and the Eagle (cf. Fig.
<a href="#fig62">62</a>): he also appears on the later Babylonian seals,
and is of very frequent occurrence in the Assyrian bas-reliefs.</p>

<p>Here they are seen employed in the chase (cf. Pl.
<a href="#pXXa">XX</a>). The Assyrian hounds apparently resembled mastiffs,
and according to Layard the breed is still extant
in Tibet though not in Mesopotamia. We have another
good reproduction of a dog on a terra-cotta plaque found
by Sir H. Rawlinson at Birs-Nimrûd (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig88">88</a>), while
Ashur-bani-pal has left us a number of clay models of
his dogs, made in one piece like the colossal bulls, but
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 19</span>rather crude in workmanship. Though we thus know
little about the breeds of dogs with which the Assyrians
and Babylonians were familiar, we at all events know,
that they were acquainted with dogs of various colours,
for they derived omens from piebald dogs, yellow dogs,
black dogs, white dogs and the rest.</p>

<p>The <i>Gazelle</i> was known in Mesopotamia from an early
day, and he sometimes appears to take the place of the
goat as a victim for sacrifice.</p>

<p>The <i>Antelope</i> is often found represented on early cylinder-seals,
and apparently it was occasionally yoked to
the plough, as may be seen from an early stone relief
from Nippur,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> but it is not always easy to distinguish between
the antelope and the goat in Babylonian art.</p>

<p>The <i>Ibex</i> is similarly liable to be confused with the
mountain sheep, owing to the shape of their horns,
but where correctly depicted, it has a beard. A good and
very early example of the Ibex is to be found engraved on
a fragment of shell belonging to the earliest Sumerian
period (cf. Louvre Cat. No. 222).</p>

<p>The <i>Boar</i> was not often figured, but was without
doubt sufficiently common as it is to-day; it is found
on an extremely archaic seal (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig54">54</a>), and numbers
of little swine are repeated in four registers on a later
cylinder-seal, while on other seals, the huntsman is seen
spearing a boar, and lastly a sow with her young are represented
on one of the wall-reliefs from Sennacherib&#8217;s
palace at Kouyunjik. It is interesting to note that as
early as the time of Khammurabi<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> pork was a highly
valued food, so much so that it frequently formed part
of the temple offerings, and Ungnad calls attention to
one case where a certain maleficent person stole one of
the temple-pigs and paid a heavy penalty for so doing,
while in the official lists of the provisions for the temple,
various parts of the pig are specifically enumerated,
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 20</span>while from the inspection of pigs favourable and unfavourable
omens were derived.</p>

<p>The <i>Rabbit</i> or <i>Hare</i> is rarely found in early sculptures
or engravings, but it occurs on the later so-called
Syro-Hittite cylinders, and is occasionally portrayed on
the Assyrian bas-reliefs.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>The <i>Oryx</i>, the <i>Mountain-Sheep</i>, the <i>Stag</i>, the <i>Tortoise</i>,
the <i>Porcupine</i>, the <i>Monkey</i>, all occur occasionally on
the cylinders, while as regards the monkey, he forms
part of the tribute brought by subject peoples to Shalmaneser
II on the Black Obelisk, and is also similarly
depicted on the bas-reliefs which adorned the walls of
Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal&#8217;s palace at Nimrûd, in both of which
latter, the monkeys represented appear to belong to an
Indian species, and were clearly novelties in the eyes of
the Assyrians, who no doubt valued them accordingly.</p>

<p>There are solitary instances of the <i>Fox</i>, the <i>Frog</i> and
the <i>Bear</i>, but none of the foregoing play what may be
called an important part in the history of the country&#8217;s
art. The <i>Lion</i> and the <i>Serpent</i> occupy a prominent position
in artistic representations, and were undoubtedly
familiar and formidable entities in real life, while the
majesty of the former and the subtlety of the latter were
alone sufficient to obtain for them a place in the mythological
and heraldic symbolism of the dwellers of Mesopotamia.
The lion was known everywhere, in highlands
and lowlands alike, while he still haunts the low marsh
country of Babylonia. On the cylinder-seals he generally
appears engaged in deadly combat with Gilgamesh, the
hero of Babylonian folk-lore, or his friend Ea-bani who
of course on all occasions worsts him; he is figured in
clay and stone from the earliest (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig26">26</a>, B) to the latest
times, he is embroidered on garments, and decorates
scabbards, while he plays an all-important part in the
heraldic device of the ancient city of Lagash, which is
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 21</span>composed of an eagle with outspread wings, clutching
two lions facing in opposite directions (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig27">27</a>),
doubtless emblematic of the dominion exercised by the
king of Lagash over the peoples of the East and West
respectively. He enjoys the doubtful honour of being
the peculiar object of the Assyrian King&#8217;s attention in
later days, and afforded him the sport which he loved
above all others (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXIX">XIX</a>); individual kings slew
great numbers, and Tukulti-Ninib I (1275 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), to take
a single example, places it on record that he slew some
920 lions, just as Amen&#7717;etep III king of Egypt similarly
boasts that he killed 102 lions in the first ten years
of his reign. Originally no doubt lions were sufficiently
plentiful, but as their numbers were thinned, it became
necessary to capture and preserve them in cages till they
were required for the royal hunt (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXVII">XXVII</a>). The
lion is sometimes reproduced in colossal size, and endowed
with wings and the head of a man, in which capacity,
stationed at the portals of the King&#8217;s palace, his vocation
is to ward off the advances of malevolent and maleficent
demons, while at other times, he is less fully equipped,
and is provided only with a head, bust and hands of a
man. Always a creature of weight in more ways than
one, his body is not unfittingly adapted to the requirements
of the scales; a considerable number of bronze
lion-weights have come down to us, the workmanship
of which was probably Ph&#339;nician (as was also the ivory
work of the Assyrian empire), while the weight represented
by each lion was inscribed in Ph&#339;nician characters.
Sometimes again the hollow bronze head of a
lion formed the ornate fitting of the end of a chariot-pole.
As a general rule, the lion emblematized the
King&#8217;s enemies, hence it is that, whenever he is seen
engaged in conflict, he is always overpowered either
by sheer bodily strength as in the case of Gilgamesh,
or transfixed by an arrow, speared, or stabbed as we
see him so frequently on the bas-reliefs of Assyrian
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 22</span>palaces. But lions were probably domesticated now and
again as they are to-day. On Sir Henry Layard&#8217;s first
visit to Hillah, he was presented with two lions by
Osman Pasha; one of these, he tells us, was a well-known
frequenter of the bazaars, the butcher-shops of
which he was in the habit of regularly looting, but apart
from this amiable little vagary, he appears to have been
fairly well-behaved. In his description of the animal,
Layard says that he was &#8220;taller and larger than a St.
Bernard dog, and like the lion generally found on the
banks of the rivers of Mesopotamia was without the
dark and shaggy mane of the African species.&#8221; He
further informs us that he had however, seen lions with
a long black mane on the river Karûn, which river flows
into the Gulf not far from Mo&#7717;ammerah in the extreme
south of Babylonia; but lions of either class are very
rarely seen in Mesopotamia to-day, and these as a rule,
only at a distance.</p>

<p>The serpent played a smaller part in Mesopotamian
art than the lion, but at least from some points of view,
a not less significant one. Two serpents entwined round
a pole form the centre of the device engraved on the
famous cup (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a>) dedicated by Gudea, patesi or
priest-king of Lagash about 2450 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, to his god Nin-gish-zi-da,
who was apparently emblematized by serpents,
and on either side of the entwined reptiles, are two
winged and serpent-headed monsters, while in a few
cylinder-seals of the older period, we find a bearded god
whose body consists of a serpent&#8217;s coil. In this connection
we may compare the device on a cylinder-seal of the
same Gudea (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig64">64</a>), where the intermediary god
who is introducing the patesi to a seated deity, whom
Ward believes with some reason to be Ea, is characterized
by serpents rising from his shoulders.</p>

<p>But the most familiar example of the serpent in Babylonian
mythological representation is that of the seal on
which two beings, perhaps divine, perhaps human, are
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 23</span>seated on either side of a tree, and behind one of the two
an erect serpent is figured; this seal owes its fame to the
opinion held by earlier scholars that this scene represents
the pictorial counterpart in Babylonia of the Hebrew
tradition of the Fall.</p>

<p>Judging from the representations of snakes found on
vases, boundary-stones, cylinder-seals and elsewhere,
the snakes prevalent in Mesopotamia at the time when
these monuments were prepared, must have been of considerable
size, while we know from the literature that
some of these snakes were poisonous. The Assyrian
kings further make mention of the prevalence of snakes
in some of the countries whither they conducted expeditions,
or which were subject to them, thus Esarhaddon
for example tells us that the land of Bazu swarmed with
snakes and scorpions like grasshoppers.</p>

<p>Among other beasts familiar to the inhabitants of
Mesopotamia may be mentioned, the <i>Bison</i> (&#8220;rimu&#8221;) an
animal of the mountains and forests, which plays a conspicuous
part in the story of Gilgamesh; the old pictograph
for the bison consists of the head of an ox in
which were inclosed the three diagonal wedges which
together signify &#8220;mountain,&#8221; and thus indicate the
place of its origin. Various species of the bovine race
have been identified on the cylinder-seals of Babylonia,
showing that at the time of the making of the seals, the
memory of their existence and probably the actuality of
their presence were still felt and known. The <i>buffalo</i>
which haunts the swamps of Southern Babylonia often
occurs on cylinder-seals belonging to the time of Shar-Gâni-sharri
and his successors, and is found engraved
on fragments of shell belonging to the earliest Sumerian
period. Layard tells us that these ugly animals which
thrive in the marshes to-day supply the Arabs with large
quantities of milk and butter; they are normally managed
with ease, but they have a peculiar antipathy to the smell
of soap, and in consequence the odour of freshly-washed
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 24</span>clothes is apt to irritate them in no small degree. The
wild-bull was assiduously hunted by the Sargonid
Assyrian kings, among whom we may especially mention
Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal in this connection. (For a graphic illustration
of that king&#8217;s exploits in the chase cf. Pl. <a href="#pXVI">XVI</a>).
After the Sargonids, the bull-hunt appears no longer as
one of the principal royal sports, possibly owing to the
relentlessness with which these animals had been hunted
down by the kings of that dynasty. In the jungles, at all
events in Layard&#8217;s day, lions, leopards, lynxes, wild-cats,
jackals, hyenas, wolves, deer, porcupines and boars still
abounded, while hyenas are sufficiently common to-day.</p>

<p>The <i>Leopard</i> is occasionally figured on the more archaic
seals, but seldom on those of later date, it is distinguished
specifically by its spots; a good example of
the leopard is afforded by an archaic seal much earlier
than the time of Shar-Gâni-sharri.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> It will thus be seen
that the artistic and literary bequests of Mesopotamia
have aided us in no small degree in our endeavour to
get a general idea as to the animal-world of that country
in bygone days. Such however has been the case, only to
a very limited extent in regard to birds, where colour is a
more determining factor in their infinite variations than
form and shape: here it was that the Egyptian shone forth
in all his native genius, and succeeded in vividly depicting
so many different kinds of birds upon the walls of his
tombs by the aid of his brush and colours. In Assyria and
Babylonia, on the other hand, where the artistic genius
of the people can never really be said to have used colours
alone as the mode of its expression, the only birds frequently
found, are the eagle and the vulture,&#8212;the eagle
as the emblem of sovereign royalty, the vulture as the
ever-ready devourer of the remains of slaughtered foes&#8212;though
without doubt a great variety of birds haunted
the plains and marshes as they do to-day.</p>

<p><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 25</span>The <i>Eagle</i>, the royal bird <i>par excellence</i>, is the embodiment
of kingly rule in the heraldic arms of Lagash
as early as the time of her first dynasty, and by the time
of Gudea (2450 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) the double-headed eagle, generally
characteristic of Hittite art, has made its appearance.
It is upon the eagle&#8217;s pinions that Etana seeks
unsuccessfully to ascend to Heaven, which legend is
pictorially represented (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig62">62</a>) on various archaic
seals. In course of time the eagle becomes the aerial
support of Ashur, the god from whom Assyria derived
its name, and lends its form to the winged disc, which,
as M. Heuzey well says, is a &#8220;yet more mysterious
emblem of divinity&#8221;; the Assyrians further deemed it
worthy to receive the honour of being united with the
body of a man, the composite creature thus produced
being accredited with powers more than those enjoyed
by mere men, and apparently partaking of a semi-divine
character, while on other occasions we see its wings applied
to the human-headed body of a bull (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXV">XXV</a>)
or a lion, the combined effect of which must have been
such as to stagger the boldest of subterranean demons.</p>

<p>The long and bare-necked <i>Vulture</i> is not of frequent
occurrence in Mesopotamian art, while on cylinder-seals,
it only occurs on those known as Syro-Hittite.
The birds of prey from which the &#8220;Vulture-stele&#8221; derives
its name, no doubt are intended to represent vultures;
as also are the birds depicted on the bas-reliefs
which adorned the walls of Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s palace at
Nineveh,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> for in either case they are busily engaged in
carrying off the sharply severed limbs and heads of
fallen foes.</p>

<p>The <i>Ostrich</i> only appears in Mesopotamian art at a
late period, though in Elam rows of ostriches are found
depicted on early pottery, closely and inexplicably resembling
the familiar ostriches on the pre-dynastic pottery
of ancient Egypt. It sometimes however assumes
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 26</span>a conspicuous position in the embroidery of an Assyrian
king&#8217;s robe and is found also on a chalcedony seal in
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>The <i>Stork</i>, which in winter time feeds in the Babylonian
marshes, occurs on the cylinder-seals, but in some
cases it is difficult to determine the bird figured; the
<i>Crane</i> and the <i>Bustard</i> both appear to be represented,
while we have an undoubted instance of the <i>Swan</i> in a
soft serpentine seal which Ward regards as early Assyrian.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
The <i>Cock</i> is confined or practically confined to
cylinder-seals of the Persian period.</p>

<p><i>Ducks</i> are known to have existed by the discovery of
stone and marble weights in the form of ducks, one of
which is inscribed with the name of Nabû-shum, and
another with that of Erba-Marduk.</p>

<p><i>Doves</i> were used and appreciated from the earliest
times, for Eannatum informs us that he offered four
doves in sacrifice to the god Enzu, while <i>Swallows</i> and
<i>Ravens</i> abounded, for in the Deluge-story, both the swallow
and raven as well as the dove are sent forth by
&#7778;it-napishtim to ascertain how far the waters were
abated.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>Locusts are found on one or two seals, and also appear
as articles of diet on the Assyrian bas-reliefs (cf.
Layard, Series II, Pl. 9), where they are seen strung
up on a stick, while the scorpion is of frequent occurrence
on the cylinder-seals, and is found on some of the
earliest.</p>

<p>Fishes figure alike on seals and on palace walls, but
their presence generally seems due to the artist&#8217;s desire
to remove all doubt from the spectator&#8217;s mind with
regard to the water, of the success of his reproduction
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 27</span>of which he is by no means too sanguine. We have
one humorous episode in fish-life depicted on the walls
of Sennacherib&#8217;s palace at Kouyunjik, where a crab is
seen effectually pressing its nippers into the body of a
luckless fish, while it also occurs once on a cylinder-seal.</p>

<p>Fish were undoubtedly used for food from the earliest
times; thus Eannatum records that he presented certain
fish as offering to his gods, while one of the reforms
introduced by Urukagina, a king of the First Dynasty
of Lagash, was the deprivation from office of the extortionate
fishery inspectors. The marshes still abound
in fish, some of which attain to a considerable size;
they are for the most part barbel or carp, their flesh
although coarse affording a regular supply of food to
the Arabs.</p>

<p>It was not unnatural or unfitting that in a country
which had been created and was yearly being created
out of and at the expense of the sea, and in which the
principal means of transit were the rivers and the canals,
the fish as the lord of the waters should fulfil an important
place in the mythological and religious conceptions
entertained by the inhabitants of that country:
thus it was that the god Ea of Eridu, one of the most
famous and most important of the Babylonian gods, and
the Oannes of the Greeks, who according to one account
was the creator of the world, was represented in
the form of a fish.</p>

<p>But it is necessary to avoid falling into the danger of
assuming that all the animals, birds, fish and trees, either
figured on monuments or mentioned in the literature
of antiquity, belonged to the fauna or flora of Mesopotamia
at the time when these engravings and sculptures
were executed; the only absolutely certain and equally
obvious inference is that the existence of such fauna or
flora was known, while the degree of familiarity of the
artist with the specimen in question may, with a good
deal of reservation and allowance for the crudeness of
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 28</span>early art, be inferred from the comparative accuracy
with which he has reproduced it, and also the frequency
of its occurrence on contemporaneous works of art.
With regard to the evidence of the literature, unfortunately
in many cases there is some uncertainty as to the
identification of the animals and plants alluded to, and
furthermore, many of the animals represented pictorially
on the monuments or alluded to in the literature form
part of the tribute brought by subject states, the precise
locality of which, to complicate matters yet further, is
often uncertain. Sometimes, as in the case of the horse
(cf. p. <a href="#Page_15">15</a>), the early ideographic form of writing teaches
us something about the origin of the object mentioned,
while the appearance of an animal or tree in early Mesopotamian
art, and the existence of the same tree or
animal in Mesopotamia to-day is good argument for
including it among the ancient fauna and flora of the
country. Again with exceptions it may be assumed
that animals offered and accepted as tribute by the kings
of Babylonia and Assyria were utilized in some way
other than merely being afforded accommodation in a
zoological gardens, in which connection we may perhaps
fairly infer that kings of Assyria who accepted camels
from vassal chiefs found use for them as a means of
transit, though in the rough country of Assyria itself
the camel would not be of great use any more than to-day,
owing to the tendency of camels to slip on rough
ground, and the consequently practical necessity of confining
their use to flat sandy ground, such as is found in
Babylonia, where they are seen by the thousand to-day.</p>

<h3>(<i>b</i>) SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN
HISTORY</h3>

<p>In the early days of Babylonian history, the country
was divided up into a number of small principalities or
city-states, and the practical realization of the approved
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 29</span>truism that &#8220;unity is strength&#8221; was only attained at
a later date. In this respect also, the early history of
Babylonian civilization presents a parallel to that of ancient
Egypt, where we find the country similarly apportioned
out into a series of districts or nomes, which in
course of time tended to amalgamate and in fact crystallized
into a northern and a southern kingdom. But in
Egypt the process of unification was carried a step further,
and at about the time of the First Dynasty, the inhabitants
of Egypt owed allegiance to one lord and one lord
only&#8212;the king of the north and the south, his dual
sovereignty being emblematized by his assumption of
the crown of the north, and the crown of the south.</p>

<p>It is of course impossible to fix the date of the first
appearance of the Sumerians in Babylonia, but the sites
of their earliest known settlements were all situated in
Sumer or Southern Babylonia, their principal cities being
Ur, Erech, Nippur, Larsa, Eridu, Lagash and Umma.
It is equally impossible to give anything in the nature
of a definite date for the occupation of Northern Babylonia
or Akkad by the Semites, suffice it to say that at
the earliest period of which historical records have been
brought to light, there appears to be evidence of the
presence of Semites or Akkadians in Akkad alongside
of the Sumerians in Sumer. The principal centres of
Semitic occupation were the city of Akkad or Agade,
Babylon, Borsippa (Birs-Nimrûd), Cutha, Opis, Sippar
and Kish.</p>

<p>The city of Kish became an influential factor in Babylonian
politics from the most ancient times.</p>

<p>Thus a certain Mesilim, king of Kish, whose inscribed
mace-head was discovered at Tellô (Lagash),<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
informs us that he had dedicated the same to the god
Nin-girsu, during the patesiate of Lugal-shar-engur at
Lagash, and that he had further restored the temple of
this same god. Nothing further is known regarding
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 30</span>this patesi of Lagash, but Mesilim reigned at Kish at a
very early date, for Entemena of Lagash commences
his historical sketch of the relationship which had existed
between his own city and that of Umma with the period
of Mesilim.</p>

<p>Now the racial origin of Mesilim is a matter of doubt,
but there is no doubt as to the Semitic origin of Sharru-Gi,
Manishtusu and Urumush, later kings of Kish,
whose reigns must be assigned to the pre-Sargonic
period, and it is perhaps therefore reasonable to suppose
that the earlier Mesilim was also a Semite. If that be
the case, the mace-head of this ruler contains evidence
that the early Sumerian city of Lagash was at one
time under the domination of Semites, and conclusively
proves that&#8212;so far as documentary evidence is concerned&#8212;Sumerians
and Semites existed side by side in
Babylonia from the earliest period of Mesopotamian
civilization.</p>

<p>Some time after, Lagash succeeded in asserting her
independence, and many of her subsequent rulers style
themselves &#8220;kings.&#8221; The First Dynasty of Lagash
which was seemingly founded by Ur-Ninâ established
themselves securely for some considerable time, but the
reign of Urukagina saw the end of the dynasty, and the
capture and sack of the city by Lugal-zaggisi, a ruler of
the neighbouring city of Umma.</p>

<p>The limits of Lugal-zaggisi&#8217;s empire included Ur,
Erech, Larsa and Nippur, and he was undoubtedly one
of the most powerful rulers of his day. Other pre-Sargonic
kings whose power was specifically associated
with Erech and Ur, were Lugal-kigub-nidudu and
Lugal-kisalsi, but the extent of their sway cannot be
estimated with any degree of certainty.</p>

<p>In the time immediately preceding the establishment
of the empire of Shar-Gâni-sharri and Narâm-Sin, the
rallying point of the Semitic forces of Akkad seems to
have been the city of Kish, the conquests of whose three
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 31</span>kings Sharru-Gi Manishtusu and Urumush prepared
the way for their successors at Agade. Thus both
Manishtusu and Urumush seem to have extended their
power southward into the land of Sumer, while both
these kings warred successfully against Elam.</p>

<p>The empire of Shar-Gâni-sharri and Narâm-Sin was
however destined to entirely eclipse that of their forerunners,
for it not only embraced Mesopotamia north
and south, but also Syria and Palestine, and was in fact
the first Babylonian empire worthy of the name.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the power of the Sumerians in the south
had received a temporary check, and the patesis of Lagash,
and other Sumerian centres at the time, clearly ruled
on sufferance and not on the strength of rights which
they were prepared to assert successfully in the battle-field.</p>

<p>But on the accession of Gudea about 2450 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, the
momentarily smoking flame of Sumerian influence in
Babylonia was kindled anew, and a strong anti-Semitic
wave set in. This wave does not seem to have been
characterized by a series of wars or battles, for the records
of Gudea, the most powerful ruler among the later
patesis of Lagash, seldom refer to anything in the nature
of military achievements, but the extensiveness of his
building operations testifies to the abundance of resources
at his command, while the names of the countries
which he laid under contribution for building-materials
conclusively prove that the influence exercised by Lagash
during the reign of Gudea was considerable. The
list of the places from which he derived wood and stone
includes the mountains in Arabia and on the Syrian
coast, while he obtained copper from the mines in the
Elamite territory east of the Tigris.</p>

<p>But the importance of Lagash was soon to pass away,
and Ur became the dominating power in Babylonia.
The dynasty of Ur (<i>circ.</i> 2400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), which lasted close on
120 years, was founded by Ur-Engur. He included
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 32</span>the whole of Southern Babylonia within his sphere of
influence, while in the north, he has left evidence of his
architectural undertakings at Nippur; hence he styled
himself the &#8220;King of Sumer and Akkad,&#8221; but the fact
that his son and successor Dungi found it necessary
to reduce Babylon indicates that his authority in Akkad
was not unquestioned. Dungi reigned 58 years, during
which he reduced the whole of Babylonia beneath his
sway, and apparently annexed the greater part of Elam.
So firmly had he established his control over Elam, that
we find the capital of that country (Susa) still retained
by his successors, though frequent expeditions had to
be undertaken to maintain the &#8220;status quo.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dynasty of Ur would appear to have been brought
to an end by an invasion of Elamites; at all events Ibi-Sin,
the last king of Ur, was carried away by the Elamites,
and the rule in Babylonia then passed to the city
of Isin. The dynasty of Isin lasted some 225 years,
during which Babylonia enjoyed great prosperity.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the first half of this period the
power in Babylonia seems to have passed temporarily
into the hands of Gungunu, king of Ur and Larsa, who
laid claim to rule over the whole of Sumer and Akkad,
but his supremacy was of short duration, and Isin soon
recovered her position as the paramount power in Babylonia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Semitic element in the north was
gradually regaining its ascendency, and finally asserted
itself as a concrete fact in the establishment of a dynasty
by Sumu-abu, at the city of Babylon itself, about
2000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>At about this time the Elamites established themselves
in Southern Babylonia at Ur and Larsa under
Kudur-Mabuk and his sons Arad-Sin and Rîm-Sin,
and during the earlier part of the dynasty exercised a
suzerainty over the whole of that region. Subsequently
Rîm-Sin met with a severe defeat at the hands of Khammurabi,
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 33</span>the most illustrious king of the dynasty and
the Amraphel of the Book of Genesis, while he met with
his death at the hands of Samsu-iluna, Khammurabi&#8217;s
successor. With the death of Rîm-Sin Elamite power
in Babylonia came to an end.</p>

<p>Khammurabi consolidated the power of Babylon, and
extended his influence on all sides, but his chief title to
fame depends upon his codification of Babylonian law.
But Babylon&#8217;s supremacy in the south was soon to be
successfully challenged by Iluma-ilu who founded a
kingdom on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and inaugurated
the so-called &#8220;Second Dynasty&#8221; of the lists of
the kings.</p>

<p>Iluma-ilu was a contemporary of Samsu-iluna, whose
attacks he twice repelled. Abêshu&#8217;, the successor of
Samsu-iluna on the throne of Babylon, similarly tried
to reduce the rebellious &#8220;Country of the Sea&#8221; beneath
his sway, but without success, and from this time on,
Southern Babylonia was ruled over by the kings of the
&#8220;Country of the Sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Samsu-iluna had another foe to contend with,
besides the southern rebels, a foe moreover ultimately
destined to subjugate the whole of Babylonia, under
whose rule she was governed for several centuries.</p>

<p>The Kassites were a warlike people whose home lay
on the east of the Tigris, and to the north of Elam, and
they apparently commenced raiding Babylonian territory
in the reign of Samsu-iluna, though they do not
seem to have materially affected the Babylonian power.
About a century later however, the dynasty of Babylon
was brought to an end by an invasion of the Hittites of
Cappadocia who sacked the city, destroyed the temple
of the great city-god, Marduk, and carried off his statue
as a trophy. The Hittite conquest must have paved
the way for the invasion of the Kassites who established
themselves securely on the throne of Babylon for a very
long period. At first their sphere of influence would
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 34</span>appear to have been confined to the northern half of the
plain, but later on they extended their power to the
Country of the Sea.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Assyria in Northern Mesopotamia had
emerged as a separate and independent kingdom, and
already the signs of her future greatness were visible on
the horizon.</p>

<p>The date of the colonization of Assyria is not known,
but in any case it must have been before the time of
Khammurabi, for the country bore the name of &#8220;Assyria&#8221;
in his time, and was embraced within the limits of
his empire. The struggle for supremacy finally ended
in a victory for the northerners who under their king
Tukulti-Ninib (<i>circ.</i> 1275 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) effected the conquest of
Babylonia. In addition to his title &#8220;King of Assyria,&#8221;
Tukulti-Ninib styled himself &#8220;King of Karduniash (i.e.
Babylon), King of Sumer and Akkad.&#8221; From that date
down to the destruction of Nineveh (<i>circ.</i> 606 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), and
the foundation of the short-lived Neo-Babylonian empire
by Nabopolassar, Babylonia takes a subsidiary place
in the political history of Western Asia.</p>

<p>The immediate successors of Tukulti-Ninib I appear
to have been perpetually engaged in war with the Babylonians,
who at no period of their history readily submitted
to the Assyrian yoke. Tiglath-Pileser I&#8217;s accession
to the throne about 1100 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> inaugurated a new
period in the history of Assyrian expansion. Some of
the mountain-tribes who had owed allegiance to former
Assyrian monarchs had revolted, and Tiglath-Pileser
made it his business to crush them. The northern
Moschians who sixty years previously had been the
vassals of Assyria, had under the leadership of five
kings invaded the territory of Commagene, but they
were effectively reduced by Tiglath-Pileser, and the
land of Commagene was conquered &#8220;throughout its
whole extent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Various other tribes in the north, of whom the Nairi
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 35</span>would appear to have been the most important, were
similarly brought beneath the Assyrian sway.</p>

<p>In a campaign against Babylonia he was also successful
for the moment, and effected the reduction of Babylon,
Sippar, Opis and other cities in Lower Mesopotamia.
But his triumph here was short-lived, and the Assyrians
were expelled by Marduk-nadin-akhê, the king of
Babylon, who further invaded Assyria, and carried off
the statues of some of the Assyrian gods.</p>

<p>Ashur-bêl-kala, the son and successor of Tiglath-Pileser
I, retrieved the fortunes of the Assyrian arms
in the south, and forced Marduk-shapik-zêrim the
successor of Marduk-nadin-akhê to sue for peace.</p>

<p>But after the reigns of Tiglath-Pileser I&#8217;s two sons,
Assyria suffered a severe disaster at the hands of the
Hittites, and lost the territory gained by Tiglath-Pileser.
Northern Syria which had been compelled to
acknowledge the suzerainty of Tiglath-Pileser, now
asserted her independence, and for some time remained
the mistress of her own destinies.</p>

<p>Thus Assyria for the time being lost her position as
a world-power, and it was only in the reign of Tukulti-Ninib
II (890-885 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) that her fortunes began to revive.
The Nairi were again reduced by this king, and
apparently the whole of the valley of the Upper Tigris
was once more subjugated. Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal (885-860
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) carried on the work of expansion and re-conquest.
With the further extension of Assyrian power northwards,
the need of a capital occupying a more central
position than ancient Ashur was at once realized, and accordingly
Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal transferred the seat of his
government to Calah (Nimrûd) some forty miles north
of Ashur.</p>

<p>Nearly 500 years before, Shalmaneser I had laid the
foundations of a town at Calah, but the unsettled circumstances
of the time had retarded its growth. Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal
demolished what remained of the old town,
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 36</span>and founded a new town on the same site, and for at
least a century Calah remained the capital of the empire.</p>

<p>Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal also extended his sphere of influence
in a westerly direction and made a triumphal march
through Northern Syria, but he appears to have cautiously
refrained from coming into collision with the
powerful king of Damascus.</p>

<p>Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal&#8217;s son and successor, Shalmaneser II
(860-825) consolidated the work of his father and
grandfather and at the same time made fresh conquests
himself. His campaigns in the west brought him into
contact with the Israelites, and we find Ahab, king of
Israel, mentioned as one of the Syrian allies who rebelled
against him. Some years later, Shalmaneser
became the suzerain of Israel, and received tribute from
Jehu, the usurper.</p>

<p>After the reigns of Shalmaneser&#8217;s immediate successors,
the power of Assyria began temporarily to decline,
and the subject nations asserted their independence,
but in 745 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> Tiglath-Pileser III, or Pul as he is called
in 2 Kings xv. 19 and elsewhere, ascended the throne,
and restored the influence and authority of Assyria in
Western Asia. His wars in Syria meant disaster to
Israel and the loss of independence to Judah. Ahaz,
king of Judah, had sought the help of Tiglath-Pileser
against the allied forces of Rezin, king of Damascus,
and Pekah, king of Israel. Tiglath-Pileser at once
seized this golden opportunity of interfering with the internal
affairs of Palestine, defeated Israel and Damascus,
and carried the Israelite tribes of Reuben, Gad and
the half-tribe of Manasseh into captivity (734 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>).
Hoshea, assassinator and usurper, purchased the right
to the throne of Israel for ten talents of gold and a
certain amount of silver, but in the reign of Tiglath-Pileser&#8217;s
successor, Shalmaneser IV (727-722 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) he
became involved in an intrigue with Egypt, which led
to his deportation to Assyria where he spent the rest of
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 37</span>his days as a prisoner. Meanwhile Samaria, the capital
of his kingdom, was beleaguered, and after a two years&#8217;
siege was captured by Sargon, who deported the larger
half of the population into Assyria. Sargon, &#8220;the son
of a nobody,&#8221; i.e. a usurper, was one of the greatest of
the Assyrian kings (722-705 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) and was the first to
come into actual conflict with the Egyptians. Palestine
as a whole showed no alacrity to take up arms against
her powerful overlord, but the Philistine town of Gaza,
in reliance on the support of Egypt, refused to submit.
Hannon the Philistine commander, on failing to repulse
the Assyrian army retreated on Raphia, a town bordering
on the Egyptian frontier, where he was joined by
Shabê the Egyptian general. At Raphia the opposing
armies joined battle, and after a fierce encounter, the
allies had to retire before the better equipped and more
disciplined army of Sargon. On his return, Sargon
found it necessary to again subdue Babylonia, and he
also carried on war with Elam. He was succeeded by
his son Sennacherib (705-681 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). After having suppressed
the revolts which always seem to have signalized
the accession of a new king, Sennacherib invaded Syria,
established his authority over northern Palestine, reduced
the rebellious Philistine city of Askelon, and
then proceeded to attack the city of Ekron, to whose
assistance an Egyptian army had rallied. Their combined
forces were routed by Sennacherib at Altaku, and
Ekron fell. Judah next occupied his attention; having
captured numerous small towns and enslaved some
200,000 of the inhabitants, he proceeded to lay siege
to Jerusalem. Hezekiah the king of Judah, withstood
the siege for some time, but pressed by famine, he was
compelled to yield and purchased the safety of his city by
stripping the Temple of its treasures. Sennacherib thereupon
returned to Assyria, but two years after, Hezekiah&#8217;s
repudiation of his suzerainty occasioned another
expedition to Palestine. The Assyrian troops first stationed
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 38</span>themselves at Lachish, whence Sennacherib dispatched
a messenger to Hezekiah to demand his instant
surrender. Meanwhile Sennacherib marched westward
with a view to engaging the Egyptian army lying at
Pelusium, one of the frontier towns of Egypt. But a
sudden catastrophe&#8212;possibly an outbreak of plague&#8212;overtook
the Assyrian host, and Sennacherib returned
to Nineveh. On his arrival home, he found it necessary
to once more suppress rebellious Babylon, and to render
his work more lasting, he completely destroyed the city
(689 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). Towards the end of his reign he conducted
a campaign in Cilicia where he defeated the Greeks and
is said to have laid the foundations of the city of Tarsus.
In 681 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> he was murdered by his sons, and the crown
eventually settled on the head of Esarhaddon (681-668
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). The most striking event of his reign was the conquest
of Lower Egypt (672 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), but towards the end
of his reign Tirhakah, the Ethiopian king of Egypt, recaptured
Memphis and threatened to put an end to the
Assyrian domination; his subjugation was one of the
first acts of Ashur-bani-pal, the successor of Esarhaddon.
Judah also became disaffected, but she was speedily
reduced to submission and her king Manasseh was removed
into captivity.</p>

<p>Ashur-bani-pal succeeded Esarhaddon in 668 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
The work of re-establishing the Assyrian power in
Egypt occupied some time and was finally accomplished
by the capture of Thebes (666 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). Under Ashur-bani-pal
Assyria attained the height of her power both
at home and abroad, and the limits of her empire were
extended further than ever before. After a lengthy war,
Elam was subdued, but she subsequently joined Shamash-shum-ukîn,
the brother of Ashur-bani-pal, and viceroy
of Babylonia, in an organized revolt against Assyria,
which resulted in the defeat of Shamash-shum-ukîn,
and the ultimate capture and sack of Susa the Elamite
capital (<i>circ.</i> 640 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>).</p>

<p><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 39</span></p>

<p>While Ashur-bani-pal was thus preoccupied with
Babylonia and Elam, Lydia on the one hand, and Egypt
on the other seized the opportunity to throw off the
yoke of their suzerain. Lydia was reduced, but Egypt
succeeded in maintaining her independence. Towards
the close of Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s reign, the wheel of fortune
had already begun to turn, and clouds were already
gathering on the eastern horizon. The Medes had made
an inroad into Assyrian territory before his death in 626
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and a few years after that event, Cyaxares king of
the Medes inflicted a defeat on the Assyrian army and
laid siege to Nineveh. But the end was temporarily
stayed by the advance of the Scythian hordes.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Nineveh was again attacked by
Cyaxares and Nabopolassar, an Assyrian general in command
of Babylonia, and after a two years&#8217; siege the city
was taken and destroyed (<i>circ.</i> 606 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). Assyria now
passed under the power of the Medes, and Babylonia
fell to Nabopolassar who founded the New or Neo-Babylonian
empire. This late Babylonian empire only lasted
about seventy years in all. Nabopolassar was succeeded
by Nebuchadnezzar, who at the time of his father&#8217;s death
was engaged in a campaign against Necho king of Egypt,
upon whom he inflicted a severe defeat at Carchemish.
His Palestinian expeditions led to the capture of Jerusalem,
and the removal of a large part of the population
of Judah into captivity. Both Jehoiakim, and Zedekiah,
kings of Judah, strove to throw off the Babylonian yoke
but without avail. Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s successors did
little deserving of narration, and in the reign of Nabonidus,
Babylon, which was under the command of Belshazzar,
was captured by Cyrus, 539 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and Babylonia
passed under the rule of the Persians. She
remained under Persian rule until the time of Alexander
the Great&#8217;s ascendency when she became a Greek province.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II&#8212;EXCAVATIONS</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE history of the actual excavations properly
commences with the first expedition sent out to
dig, but there is one scholar who, although he did not
excavate on any large scale, was the first to bring cuneiform
inscriptions to Europe and on this account deserves
special mention.</p>

<p>C. J. Rich, born in 1787 at Dijon, was from the early
age of nine attracted to the study of Oriental languages,
and in course of time made himself master of Hebrew,
Persian, Aramaic and Arabic, while he is said to have
attempted to read Chinese Hieroglyphics at the phenomenal
age of fourteen. In 1803 he became a Cadet in
the East India Company&#8217;s service, his military post being
subsequently exchanged for a civil appointment. After
visiting Egypt, Palestine, Asia Minor and other countries,
he returned to Bombay, but was, before the age
of twenty-four, appointed the East India Company&#8217;s
resident at Baghdad. In 1811 he visited the ruins of
Babylon, an account of which is to be found in his
&#8220;Memoir on the ruins of Babylon,&#8221; while his visit to
Nineveh is recorded in his &#8220;<i>Narrative of a Residence
in Koordistan and on the site of ancient Nineveh, with
Journal of a voyage down the Tigris to Baghdad, and an
account of a visit to Shiraz and Persepolis</i>.&#8221; It is moreover
to Rich that we owe our first accurate plans of both
Nineveh and Babylon. In the course of his travels,
he made large collections consisting chiefly of Arabic,
Persian, Turkish, Aramaic and Syriac manuscripts, a
number of Greek and oriental coins, and also many
antiquities from Babylon and Nineveh, including the
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 41</span>first cuneiform tablets seen in Europe: his collections
were acquired by the Trustees of the British Museum,
after his death from cholera in 1820.</p>

<p>But as the pioneer in the actual field of excavation,
M. Botta, the French Consul at Mosul, occupied the
first place in point of time. In the year 1842, on
the advice of Mohl, he began the exploration of the
Mound of Kouyunjik, one of the two mounds which
mark the site of the city of Nineveh, but meeting with
scant success, he transferred his attention in 1843 to
the Mound of Khorsabad (the town of Chosroes) some
miles north of Mosul, where he laid bare the ruins of
a palace which proved to be that of Sargon, king of
Assyria (722-705 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) and the father of Sennacherib.
In the year 1851 the French Assembly voted the money
for an expedition to Babylonia, and also for another
expedition to Assyria, the object of which was to complete
the excavations which had been commenced with
so much promise at Khorsabad: this expedition was
directed by Victor Place who at the same time succeeded
Botta as French Consular agent at Mosul.
During the years 1851-1855 Place completed the excavation
of Sargon&#8217;s palace, and also laid bare the surrounding
buildings and rooms, carrying his work right
up to the wall of the town; Khorsabad was found to
contain the ruins of a whole fortified town, which had
remained entombed for some 2500 years: the town
was named Dûr-Sharrukîn after its founder Sargon.
The four corners of the city walls were oriented towards
the four cardinal points, the walls themselves
being pierced by eight enormous gates, each of which
was named after an Assyrian deity. The palace had
been built on a terraced mound 45 feet high, which
was made of crude or unbaked bricks, and was protected
by a casing-wall of large square stones. The
palace contained wide halls, adorned with sculptures,
winged bulls and the like. The floors of the various
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 42</span>chambers consisted generally of stamped clay, and were
no doubt hidden from view by elaborate rugs, sometimes,
however, tiles or blocks of marble concealed the
unsightly clay.</p>

<p>The walls were of great thickness, i.e. from 9-1/2 to 16
feet, while in one place they measured as much as 25-1/2 feet.
The inner walls of the less important chambers were only
covered with a white plaster surrounded by black lines,
the so-called women&#8217;s apartments, on the other hand,
being decorated with frescoes and white or black arabesques.
Marble statues were unearthed in the harem
court, and the remains of a ziggurat or stage-tower&#8212;a
characteristic feature in Mesopotamian temples&#8212;were
brought to light. Place&#8217;s excavations were not
so productive of large sculptures and monuments as
those of Botta had been, but they were particularly
fruitful as regards smaller objects of glass, stone, clay,
and metal.</p>

<p>The first Englishman to enter the field was Layard
who in 1845, only two years after Botta&#8217;s first expedition,
commenced excavating the ruined mounds of
Nimrûd. Nimrûd, which proved to be the ancient
Calah, was built on a rectangular plateau just as Khorsabad
had been, and the exploration of its site yielded a
rich harvest of new materials for the reconstruction of
the history of the past. Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal, king of Assyria
(885-860), following the example of Shalmaneser I
(about 1300), removed the seat of government from
Ashur forty miles northwards, to Calah, where he built
a palace for himself, the excavation of which was one of
Layard&#8217;s greatest triumphs. This palace occupied the
north-western portion of the mound and was in part restored
by Sargon; to the north of this palace of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal
lay the site of the temple of Ninib or Adar, the
god of war. Shalmaneser II (860-825) the successor of
Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal, also built a palace at Calah, on the south-east
of that of his predecessor; this palace, known as the
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 43</span>central palace, was almost entirely rebuilt by Tiglath-Pileser
III, the Biblical Pul (745-727 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>).</p>

<p>At the south-west corner, the palace of Esarhaddon
(681-668) was excavated, in the construction of which,
that king utilized the materials of the older palaces in the
most unscrupulous fashion, but the building was found
to have been much damaged by fire. North of Esarhaddon&#8217;s
palace and south of that of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal, lay
the comparatively small palace of Adad-nirari III (812-783
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), and in the south-east corner of the parallelogram
the insignificant remains of the palace of Ashur-etil-ilâni
(about 625) one of the last of Assyria&#8217;s monarchs
were brought to light.</p>

<p>Thus Layard discovered and excavated the remains
of some seven royal palaces at Nimrûd; of these seven
that of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal was by far the most important
from the archæological and historical standpoint.</p>

<p>Wall bas-reliefs, human-headed winged lions and bulls
(cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXV">XXV</a>), obelisks, bronze bowls, iron reaping-hooks
and spear-heads, carved ivory panels and mirrors, a
&#8220;silver-plated&#8221; sceptre-head, and a variety of bells are
a few among the many valuable finds at Nimrûd, each of
which makes its contribution, be it small or be it great,
to the restoration of a page of human history and cultural
evolution.</p>

<p>But undoubtedly the most impressive monuments
yielded by Assyrian excavations are the gigantic winged
bulls and lions which were stationed at the royal palace
gates. The removal of these monsters of oriental antiquity
was an even more difficult task than their excavation,
and taxed the inventive powers of both French and
English explorers to the utmost.</p>

<p>Those excavated by the French at Khorsabad were
embarked piecemeal for Paris, the parts into which they
had been sawn, with a view to facilitating their transit,
being fitted together again in the Louvre, the museum
which they now adorn. Layard however adopted a
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 44</span>different method in effecting the transport of the
winged bulls from Nimrûd to London, by means of
which he successfully brought them over intact without
breaking them up in any way; the extraordinary
difficulties involved in this feat give us a vivid conception
of the similar difficulties which the Assyrians must
have had to overcome in the removal of these solid stone
masses from the quarry to the entrances of the palaces,
and in the exact adjustment of them in their specific
places. Layard gives us a detailed description<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> of the
plan he devised for the removal of some of these unwieldy
monsters, of which thirteen pairs had already
been discovered. His first efforts were directed towards
two of the smaller colossi. The first and greatest problem
to be solved was how to lower them without risk
of their falling and so being broken. The sculptures
were first of all wrapped in mats or felt to mitigate the
effect of any misfortune that might befall them, either
through the ropes giving way or cutting the soft stone.
Heavy wooden rollers had been procured from the
mountains; these were placed upon sleepers laid parallel
to the sculpture, and it only now remained to lower
the winged creature on to the rollers; this was effected
by means of ropes skilfully applied, the descent of the
gradually sinking monument being checked by thick
beams which supported it in its fall and were gradually
withdrawn as the occasion required. As the bull approached
the rollers the beams had to be entirely removed,
the whole of the weight and strain thus being on
the cables and ropes, which stretched until finally they
reached breaking point, and the bull fell some four feet or
more to the ground, but fortunately without being damaged.
A trench of about 200 feet in length, 15 feet wide,
and in some places 20 feet deep, having been duly made
through which the bull might proceed on the rollers to
the edge of the mound&#8212;this course was necessary owing
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 45</span>to the impossibility of lifting such a massive weight&#8212;the
giant animal was slowly pulled by a large number
of Arabs to the end of the trench and down the slope
of the mound, where it was lowered on to a specially-constructed
cart, which had been a nine days&#8217; wonder
to the natives ever since its appearance. The cart itself
was fitted with two strong axles which had been used
by Botta in the removal of sculptures from Khorsabad.
&#8220;Each wheel was formed of three solid pieces, nearly
a foot thick, from the trunk of a mulberry tree, bound
together by iron hoops. Across the axles were laid three
beams, and above them several cross-beams, all of the
same wood. A pole was fixed to one axle to which were
also attached iron rings for ropes to enable men as well
as buffaloes to draw the cart. The wheels were provided
with movable hooks for the same purpose.&#8221; The mulberry
wood used had of course to be procured in the
mountains, there being no wood of the required substance
or size in the Mesopotamian valley. Buffaloes were first
harnessed to the pole, while a number of men tugged
at the ropes attached to the wheels and the movable
hooks, but the buffaloes appear to have soon struck, and
they were consequently taken out, the whole of the work
now being done by three hundred Arabs. At length,
after multitudinous efforts, the bull arrived at the river
where it was landed on a specially-prepared platform
from which it might slide on to a raft. Thus much for
the obstacles to be surmounted in the mere removal of
these enormous blocks of stone by an excavator of the
nineteenth century, from which we may form a small and
very inadequate estimate of the indomitable zeal and invincible
energy of the Assyrians some twenty-six or
twenty-seven centuries ago in quarrying, carving, transporting
and fixing the guardian genii.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Excavations at Nimrûd (Calah) in Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal&#8217;s Palace</span></p>
</div>

<p>Calah (Nimrûd) was the capital of Assyria for 220
years (885-668), but at the close of that period she had
to yield her pre-eminence to Nineveh, which Sennacherib
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 46</span>rebuilt and which was the capital of the empire from his
time till the end of the chapter, i.e. till about 630 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
Sennacherib naturally built a palace at his new capital,
Nineveh, and the discovery and excavation of this palace
are also due to the indefatigable efforts of the late Sir
Henry Layard and his assistant Hormuzd Rassam.
This palace of Sennacherib occupied the south-west
corner of the northern of the two groups of mounds
known as Kouyunjik which mark the site of ancient
Nineveh, Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s (668-626 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) palace being
located immediately to the north of it. Unfortunately
Sennacherib&#8217;s palace suffered from fire when the Medes
took the city in 606 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> in consequence of which most
of his wall bas-reliefs are greatly marred. The complete
excavation of this palace was the great triumph of
Layard&#8217;s second campaign (1849-1851), and the bas-reliefs
taken from the walls of its seventy or more halls
and chambers now form, in spite of their comparatively
bad state of preservation, one of the most priceless possessions
of the British Museum. But one more epoch-making
discovery in the annals of Mesopotamian excavations
must be attributed to this world-renowned excavator.</p>

<p>One day Layard discovered two chambers connected
with each other, and after removing the débris, he found
that &#8220;to the height of a foot or more from the floor they
were entirely filled with cuneiform tablets of baked clay,
some entire, but the greater part broken into many fragments.&#8221;</p>

<p>In point of fact he had chanced upon part of the library
of Ashur-bani-pal, one of Assyria&#8217;s greatest kings; the
library appears to have been stored partly in the northern
palace, that of Ashur-bani-pal proper, and partly in
the south-western palace built by Sennacherib; it was
in the latter that the rooms referred to were found; the
other half of this great library of the later Assyrian kings
was subsequently unearthed by Rassam. The contents
of these tablets, made of the finest clay and ranging from
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 47</span>one to fifteen inches, are as varied as the tablets themselves.
Some of them contain historical records, others
astronomical reports, or mathematical calculations: there
are also letters of a private and public character, but the
majority of the tablets deal with astrology and medicine,
both of which subjects were intimately connected in the
mind of the Babylonian. Prayers, incantations, psalms
and religious texts in general, formed a considerable part
of this library, and as a large proportion of the &#8220;volumes&#8221;
or tablets are not original works but copies from
earlier Babylonian productions, the value of the library,&#8212;now
known under the name of the &#8220;Kouyunjik collection,&#8221;&#8212;for
the study of the religious and mythological
conceptions of both the Babylonians and Assyrians is
more than can be adequately estimated. Many of the
tablets are bilingual, the ideographic Sumerian being provided
with an Assyrian interlinear translation, and these,
together with other tablets of the collection containing
syllabaries in which the Sumerian value, the Assyrian
name, and sometimes the Assyrian meaning of different
signs are given, have been of the utmost use in the rediscovery
of the languages of Mesopotamia. Layard
also visited Babylonia, and began to excavate at Babylon
and Nippur, but his Babylonian operations were not attended
with the extraordinary success of his excavations
at Nineveh and Calah.</p>

<p>In 1851 a French expedition was sent out to Babylonia
under Fresnel and Jules Oppert: they secured various
relics from the ruined mounds of Babylon, among which
may be especially mentioned a fine collection of coloured-brick
fragments, but unfortunately all was lost through
a mishap on the Tigris in 1855.</p>

<p>In 1852 Rassam succeeded Layard in the field, and at
once had to contend with difficulties resulting from Rawlinson&#8217;s
concessions to Victor Place, to whom he had
transferred the right of excavating what remained to be
excavated at Kouyunjik, which from Rassam&#8217;s point of
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 48</span>view fell within the sphere of British influence, and to
which therefore British excavators had a prior claim. In
1853 Rassam commenced operations at &#7730;alat Sher&#7731;ât,
but apart from the discovery of two clay prisms inscribed
with the annals of Tiglath-Pileser I (<span class="smcap">1100-1080
B.C.</span>), the ancient Ashur did not yield much fruit on this
occasion. At Calah, the scene of Layard&#8217;s brilliant triumphs,
Rassam discovered E-zida, the temple of Nebo,
the god who vied with Marduk for the first place in the
Babylonian pantheon of later days, and whose name is
commemorated in the names of several of the kings of
the first Babylonian empire, as also in three of those of
the second empire, the most familiar of whom is the
Biblical Nebuchadnezzar; six large statues of the god
were brought to light, two of which at all events are by
their inscriptions shown to be contemporaneous with the
Assyrian king Adad-nirari III (812-783); a stele of
King Shamshi-Adad II (825-812 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), and the remains of
an inscribed obelisk of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal complete the list
of his principal finds on this site. But his name will be
for ever associated with Kouyunjik; his first efforts were
productive of no very great results beyond the discovery
of a limestone obelisk of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal covered with
bas-reliefs, and now in the Assyrian Transept of the British
Museum, and a female torso from the palace of Ashur-bêl-kala,
king of Assyria about 1080 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXIV">XXIV</a>).
Rassam however profited by Victor Place&#8217;s omission to
make use of the permission accorded to him by Rawlinson
to explore the northern part of Kouyunjik, but at
the same time took the precaution of making his initial
operations under the cover of night. His nocturnal
labours were crowned with the greatest success which
the excavators of those days could have&#8212;the discovery
of a new palace&#8212;and after he was satisfied on this point,
the digging was allowed to proceed during the daytime,
as it is a recognized rule that the discoverer of a new
palace has established his claim to the complete excavation
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 49</span>of it, as against the rest of the world. The newly-discovered
palace turned out to be that of Ashur-bani-pal,
king of Assyria (668-626 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), in whose reign Assyria
attained the height of her power both at home and abroad,
extending her sway even as far as Thebes, the capital of
Upper Egypt, which was taken and sacked by this king
in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 666. But Ashur-bani-pal as well as being a great
warrior, was also a great huntsman, and the bas-reliefs
which he caused to be sculptured upon the walls of his
palace at Kouyunjik, in commemoration of his exploits
in the chase, are probably the masterpieces of Assyrian
art. They thus testify not only to the sportsmanship of
this king, but also to the encouragement which he gave
to art, while Rassam&#8217;s further discovery of the other half
of Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s library has shown that king to have
been an even greater patron of literature than there had
hitherto been reason to suppose.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1854, funds failed and Rassam was
in consequence obliged to return, but shortly afterwards
he accepted a political appointment at Aden.
The meanwhile, work had already been commenced in
Babylonia by W. K. Loftus who carried on small excavations
at Warka, the ancient Erech, the ruins of
which are the largest in Babylonia, but though many
interesting antiquities were unearthed, none of them
are of an epoch-making character, the slipper-shaped
coffins belonging to the Parthian period, being perhaps
the best known. Owing to the fact that Erech has been
occupied during the greater part of its history, i.e. some
5000 years, it is not a fruitful mine for early antiquities.
Senkereh (Larsa) on the other hand, which has
been identified with the Ellasar of Genesis xiv. 1, seems
to have remained more or less unoccupied after the Persian
period, and hence it is a better site for the exploration
and study of the earlier history of Southern Mesopotamia.
Inscribed bricks from Senkereh show that
Khammurabi (the Amraphel of Genesis xiv.?), and the
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 50</span>most famous king of the first dynasty of Babylon, repaired
the ancient temple-tower there, as also did his
Neo-Babylonian successor, Nabonidus, some fourteen
centuries later, while the famous Nebuchadnezzar of Old
Testament fame had also not neglected it in his works
of restoration. The lower strata of the mound showed
that Ur-Engur, King of Ur, whose reign may probably
be assigned to the latter part of the third millennium
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, had also made his presence felt in this ancient city
of Larsa. Subsequently Larsa shared the fate of other
early Babylonian cities, and was used as a cemetery: the
tablets found near the coffins apparently belong to a
much earlier date, and were probably found by the grave-diggers
to whom their altered position is to be ascribed.
Excavations were also conducted at the same time at
Tell Sifr, which resulted in the discovery of about a
hundred so-called case-tablets (i.e. tablets protected by
a clay cover or envelope), belonging to the time of the
first dynasty of Babylon, which in their turn led to the
discovery of a hitherto unknown king of this dynasty,
Samsu-iluna, the successor of Khammurabi.</p>

<p>When Loftus was excavating at Warka at the beginning
of 1854, J. E. Taylor, the Vice-Consul at Basra,
undertook excavations on behalf of the British Museum
at Mu&#7731;eyyer, the site of the ancient city of Ur. He
commenced operations on what appeared at the time, and
what ultimately turned out to be, the principal building
of the city, the temple of the Moon-god Sin, in the
four corners of which he discovered four clay cylinders,
and also another barrel-shaped cylinder the inscription
of which is of even greater importance than those of the
corner-cylinders. We learn that Ur-Engur, King of
Ur, built the temple, that his son Dungi repaired it, and
that Nabonidus the last King of Babylon restored it some
two thousand years later. These foundation-cylinders
of Nabonidus proved of great historical interest, the
inscription on each of them concluding with a prayer for
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 51</span>Bêl-shar-u&#7779;ur, the King&#8217;s son and heir, the Belshazzar
of Daniel v., who was in command of Babylon at the
time of the capture of the city by Cyrus. Taylor also
conducted excavations on other Babylonian sites, the
most important of which was Abû Shahrein, the ancient
Eridu whose god Ea was one of the most illustrious as
well as one of the most time-honoured gods in Babylonia.
Its ruins are smaller than those of Ur, but they contain
the remains of a temple-tower, consisting of two storeys,
which Taylor laid bare. From the inscribed bricks
recovered, the identification of this site with the ancient
Eridu was established.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1854, Sir Henry
Rawlinson commenced excavating Birs-Nimrûd, the
Borsippa of antiquity; he commenced digging at the
four corners of what ultimately proved to be the
famous E-zida, the temple of Nebo, in search of clay
cylinders such as had been found at the corners of
other Babylonian buildings; he recovered two such
foundation-cylinders which turned out to be duplicates,
together with fragmentary parts of other cylinders, all
of which had been deposited there by Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>Soon after Rassam&#8217;s return from Assyria in the year
1854, Loftus entered the service of the Trustees of
the British Museum, and was sent out to continue the
excavation of Kouyunjik. Loftus ably followed up the
work of his predecessor; new reliefs were brought to
light, the most celebrated of which perhaps is that of
Ashur-bani-pal and his queen reclining at meat in the
garden (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXI">XXI</a>), but again though the spirit was
willing, the funds were weak, and Loftus had to abandon
all hope of completing the excavation of the palace
of Assyria&#8217;s most famous king.</p>

<p>The abundant harvest, yielded by these numerous
excavations in Mesopotamia, and stored away in the
Museums, afforded a supply of material copious enough
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 52</span>to occupy the intellectual acumen of the savants for some
time to come, while the general public whose interest
in these archæological expeditions depended on the
tangible results forthcoming, were inclined to await the
decipherment and publication of the accumulated mass
of clay tablets, monuments and stelæ already to hand,
before furnishing the necessary funds for any fresh expeditions,
and it was not till 1873 that George Smith,
the able assistant of Sir Henry Rawlinson, whose discovery
of the Babylonian account of the Deluge had
alike won for him great fame, and also kindled again
the enthusiasm of the public in the cause of excavation,
was enabled, thanks to the munificence of the proprietors
of the &#8220;Daily Telegraph,&#8221; to personally conduct an expedition
to Mesopotamia. In the January of that year
Smith set out for Mosul, but on his arrival, he found
to his dismay that the requisite firmân had not as yet
been granted by the Turkish Government, and he accordingly
journeyed southward, examining the ruined
mounds of Nimrûd and &#7730;alat Sher&#7731;at on the way. In
northern Babylonia he spent but a short time which he
employed in visiting the sites of Babylon, Borsippa
(Birs-Nimrûd) and other ancient ruins, but by the beginning
of April, he obtained the necessary permission to
excavate in Assyria, and accordingly returned at once to
Mosul. His attention was first of all directed to Nimrûd,
the scene of so many of Layard&#8217;s triumphs, but his
predecessors in the field had reaped their harvest to the
full, and the gleanings which remained were poor and
meagre.</p>

<p>In the following month he transferred the seat of his
operations to Kouyunjik, with a view to discovering the
remainder of Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s library. The work was
far from easy owing to the complete state of confusion
in which the ruins then were, partly owing to the work
of earlier excavators, partly owing to the builders of the
bridge at Mosul who had made use of the remains of
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 53</span>Assyria&#8217;s ancient buildings for the construction of the
bridge, and partly owing to the instability of some of
Layard&#8217;s tunnels, which had the meanwhile collapsed.
Here too, the harvest was past and the summer of
Assyrian excavations was ended, but the object which the
&#8220;Daily Telegraph&#8221; proprietors had in view was realized
in the discovery of another fragment of the Babylonian
account of the Deluge, which proved to fill in the chief
lacuna in the story. Smith had entertained the hope
that this all-important discovery would be an inducement
to his financiers to grant an additional sum for
the continuation of the work, but they declined. Smith
accordingly had reluctantly to set his face westward and
return to London, but before the year was out he was
on his way back to the Orient, the Trustees of the British
Museum having voted £1000 for another expedition
thither. He arrived at Mosul on New Year&#8217;s Day 1874,
and recommenced his quest for tablets, but the time at
his disposal was short, his firmân expiring in the ensuing
March; this notwithstanding, in the three months
spent at Kouyunjik on these two expeditions, he
brought to light some three thousand tablets dealing
with a variety of different subjects, and providing invaluable
material for the student of Babylonian and
Assyrian astronomy, theology and chronology. To him
is due not only the rediscovery of the Babylonian story
of the Flood, but also of portions of the Creation
legends, and of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the hero of
Babylonian folk-lore, while to the student of Old
Testament History, his discovery of Sargon&#8217;s own
account of his campaign against the city of Ashdod
recorded in the twentieth chapter of Isaiah is of paramount
importance. In the spring of 1876 Smith
conducted his third and last expedition to Assyria,
under the auspices of the British Museum, the value
of whose collections he had already so greatly enhanced.
But he arrived to find the cholera rampant all over the
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 54</span>country, and confusion and disorder reigned everywhere.
To excavate under such circumstances was an
impossibility, but Smith spared no effort in his futile
endeavour to overcome the impossible, boldly facing all
dangers and difficulties, but he ultimately succumbed
to the disastrous effects of climate and exposure, and
died at Aleppo in August 1876, a martyr to the cause
of science. George Smith was not only an excavator,
but also a scholar, and his scholastic achievements are
the more praise-worthy, when it is recollected that he
was practically a self-educated man, who by dint of his
extraordinary perseverance and indomitable will succeeded
where other men of perhaps greater ability failed,
and who on that account alone is entitled to the prominent
place which he occupies in the annals of Assyriology.</p>

<p>Soon after the death of George Smith in 1876, the
Trustees of the British Museum requested Rassam to resume
his long-abandoned labours in Assyria, and after
some unavoidable delay, operations were commenced in
January 1878. The work was greatly facilitated by the
presence of Sir Henry Layard as British special representative
at Constantinople, for the latter having always
been on friendly terms with the Turkish Government,
was consequently able to secure concessions which might
well have been denied to anyone else. Rassam&#8217;s marching
orders were sufficiently explicit, he was sent out to
continue the excavation of Nineveh, but his heart was
bent on the discovery of palaces and temples rather than
on the comparatively unexciting task of searching for
tablets, the importance or non-importance of which could
never be determined off-hand, without a detailed study
of the contents. His ambition was satisfied shortly after
his arrival: a year before his resumption of the work of
Assyrian exploration two portions of a bronze door-panel
covered with figures and cuneiform characters had
been sent to him by a friend, and immediately on his
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 55</span>return to Assyria he made enquiries as to where these
pieces of worked metal had been unearthed. He soon discovered
that they formed part of a large bronze door-panel
discovered quite accidentally by a peasant in a mound,
some fifteen miles east of Mosul, called Balâwât. Accordingly,
his immediate desire was to discover the remainder
of this unique monument of ancient metallurgy,
and with that end in view he determined to explore the
Balâwât mound. He discovered that the site had been
used as a cemetery by the inhabitants of the neighbourhood,
and was consequently outside the limits of
his firmân, but disregarding the risk of a collision with
the authorities and the still more imminent risk of inciting
the native population to open resistance, for no
people civilized or uncivilized are in the habit of passively
acquiescing in the disinterment of their dead, he
determined to hazard everything in pursuit of his prize.
Success attended his efforts, and very soon after the
cutting of the first trenches, fragments of bronze plates
similar to those which had previously come to light, were
unearthed. In the course of a short time, the remaining
panels were duly restored to the light of day: these
panels had once upon a time decorated the wooden gates
of a large building, to which they were affixed. The
scenes portrayed thereon represent incidents in the life
and campaigns of Shalmaneser II (860-825 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), the
successor of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal, and the first Assyrian king
who is known to have come into immediate contact with
Israel. In the course of his excavation of the mound, he
came across the ruins of a small temple, and a large
coffer made of marble containing two tablets made of
the same material and bearing inscriptions of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal.
Rassam&#8217;s work at Kouyunjik and Nimrûd
was also far from fruitless, though Nimrûd certainly
failed to yield a harvest in any way comparable to that of
bygone days, a few bas-reliefs, a number of clay tablets
and some enamelled tiles practically comprising all that
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 56</span>Nimrûd contributed to the study of Assyrian antiquity
on this occasion. So too at Kouyunjik, clay inscriptions
were the chief and indeed practically the only fruits of
the excavations carried on by Rassam during his four
expeditions (1878-1882). The most epoch-making of
these inscriptions consisted in a ten-sided baked clay
prism containing the annals of Ashur-bani-pal, and four
barrel-shaped cylinders inscribed with an account of
Sennacherib&#8217;s various campaigns. Rassam further attempted
the complete exploration of Nebi Yûnus, the
second large mound which marks the site or part of the
site of ancient Nineveh, but he did not meet with the
success which his indefatigable efforts deserved, owing
to the innate factiousness and aptitude for intrigue which
lie dormant in the Oriental breast even at the best of
times, and which on this occasion so far from being dormant,
showed themselves in all their pristine vigour, the
result of which was the cessation of Rassam&#8217;s labours,
and the final dissipation of all his hopes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile excavations were also going on in Babylonia,
excavations moreover which were destined to
usher in a new era of Babylonian exploration, and
which proved of incalculable value both to the archæologist,
and also to the student of early art. In the
spring of 1877, some few months before Rassam&#8217;s
return to Assyria after an interval of a quarter of a
century, Ernest de Sarzec, the French Vice-Consul at
Basra, started tentative operations at the ruined mounds
of Tellô, whither his attention had been directed by
J. Asfar, a native Christian, and formerly a dealer in
antiquities. Tellô had already won for itself a name
as a site likely to repay the labour entailed in its
methodical excavation, in consequence of the discovery
of inscribed cones and bricks in its ruins, and needless
to say, it has more than lived up to its early reputation,
for of all the ancient sites of Babylonian civilization,
Tellô has yielded by far the richest harvest of material
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 57</span>for the reconstruction of Sumerian history, and the
systematic study of Sumerian art and culture. It would
be impossible here to chronicle all the far-reaching results
of De Sarzec&#8217;s immortal work, and we must
therefore content ourselves with a notice of the more
important of his discoveries. On his very first visit
to Tellô he was fortunate enough to find a portion of
a dolerite statue lying at the foot of one of the mounds,
from which he correctly inferred that the statue itself
must have originally occupied a position in some large
building, the ruins of which he assumed to be lying
concealed within the mound in question. He accordingly
commenced excavating the mound, and very
shortly discovered that it contained a building of no
small dimensions, erected upon a large platform of
crude, or sun-dried bricks: the objects which he unearthed
comprised a large statue of dolerite bearing an
inscription of Gudea, priest-king of Lagash about 2450
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, inscribed door-sockets, sculptures and vases, copper
statuettes of a votive character, and last but most important
of all, the first fragments of the Vulture stele of
Eannatum, one of the most famous works of early Babylonian
art, both in regard to its antiquity and also in
regard to the manner in which it illustrates not only the
artistic but also the military operations of the Sumerians
at this remote period (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXII">XII</a>). In his next two campaigns
(1880-81) he systematically excavated the building
in the mound generally known as &#8220;A,&#8221; in the course
of which he discovered some nine or ten dolerite statues,
numerous statuettes, and a stone vase of Narâm-Sin,
son of Shar-Gâni-sharri of Agade, who probably lived
some few centuries before Gudea. The building itself,
which in the main belongs to the Parthian-period, but
in which part of the old palace of Gudea had been incorporated
is briefly discussed on page 149. But as
Prof. Hilprecht<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> truly says, the dolerite statues of
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 58</span>Gudea &#8220;will always remain the principal discovery
connected with De Sarzec&#8217;s name,&#8221; famous alike for
the animation and life with which they are inspired,
and also for the skill and dexterity which these early
Babylonians display in their treatment of the hardest
stones. Among other valuable or rather invaluable
finds may be mentioned the well-known silver vase of
Entemena (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>), the carved mace-head of Mesilim,
an enormous copper spear-head, and some bas-reliefs
of Ur-Ninâ, the founder of the First Dynasty of Lagash.
In mound &#8220;B,&#8221; De Sarzec&#8217;s excavations not only laid
bare the building of Ur-Ninâ (cf. Pl. <a href="#pVa">V</a>) but also revealed
the remains of a yet earlier structure lying beneath
the edifice of this ancient ruler, and resting on
a pavement some 16 feet below Ur-Ninâ&#8217;s platform.
Copper statuettes and stone bas-reliefs of a most archaic
character were also brought to light on this occasion.</p>

<p>In 1889 De Sarzec left Babylonia, not to return till
1894, when he renewed his excavations in mound &#8220;B.&#8221;
Two wells and a watercourse of Eannatum&#8217;s time were
discovered, while among the small relics of this long-forgotten
age were various pieces of shell carved with
pictures of trees and animals. It would be altogether
impossible to over-estimate the debt which both the
historian of early Babylonia, and the student of early
Mesopotamian art owe to the work of that distinguished
excavator; if to Layard, Botta, and Place is due the
opening up of the book of Assyria&#8217;s ancient history, and
the breaking of the seals that had kept that book closed
for so long a period, to De Sarzec we owe the recovery
of an even earlier page in the history of human life and
progress. The last quarter of the 19th century which
embraced the period of De Sarzec&#8217;s extraordinary activity
in the archæological field (the first of his expeditions
being conducted in 1877 and the last in 1900) will remain
for all time memorable for the epoch-making
discoveries in Babylonia, discoveries which posterity
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 59</span>will for ever associate with the name of the illustrious
French excavator.</p>

<p>The meanwhile Rassam, had used to the utmost the
facilities granted to him under the generous terms of
the 1878 firmân, and had covered as much ground and
visited as many sites as possible, though whether science
would have gained more by the systematic exploration
of a few mounds than by the ransacking of many is a
question which would probably have to be answered in
the affirmative. In 1879, he commenced operations in
Babylonia, the ruined mounds of Babylon and Borsippa
being the first to receive his attention. On his arrival
he found a number of Arabs busily engaged in extracting
building material from the Babil mound, and in the
course of their digging they came upon four wells, some
140 feet deep, and made of blocks of red granite, each
block being about 3 feet high, and fitted to the adjoining
block with an extraordinary degree of precision.
From the general appearance of the mound as well as
from the magnitude of the ruined walls which it covered,
Rassam came to the conclusion arrived at by Rich
nearly a century before, and accepted by Hilprecht some
years later, that to Babil we must look for the world-renowned
hanging gardens of Diodorus and Pliny.</p>

<p>Rassam&#8217;s trenches on the &#7730;asr mound were attended
with no important results, but his work at the Jumjuma
mound in the South,&#8212;so called from the name of the
modern village now situated there,&#8212;yielded a rich harvest
of tablets, mostly of a commercial character. Borsippa
in like manner responded to the appeal made to it
by the spade of Rassam, many tablets being recovered,
while a large part of the renowned temple of E-zida,
dedicated to the god Nebo, once again saw the light of
day: among the smaller relics, the recovery of a bronze
step of the famous Nebuchadnezzar is deserving of
special mention, and also a baked clay cylinder of the
time of Antiochus Soter 270 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, the latter being, according
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 60</span>to Hilprecht, &#8220;the last royal document composed in
the Old Babylonian writing and language.&#8221; But perhaps
Rassam&#8217;s most valuable contribution to Assyriology
was the identification of the site of ancient Sippar.
Many unsuccessful attempts had previously been made
to locate this city, so frequently mentioned in the cuneiform
inscriptions, and already George Smith had tentatively
suggested the mound of Abû Habba, located about
thirty miles north of the City of Babylon, as its possible
site, but to Rassam we owe the actual identification of
the site of this old centre of the worship of Shamash the
Sun-god in the Babylonian plain. The ruins of Abû
Habba are low but extensive, the longest of the ancient
city-walls measuring some 1400 yards, while on the
western side the remains of an old ziggurat, or temple-tower
are still to be seen. Rassam&#8217;s excavations on this
site were abundantly successful, the most important of
his discoveries in the ancient building with which he
was principally concerned, being the famous stone tablet
of Nabû-aplu-iddina, king of Babylonia, about 870 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
The inscription which records the restoration of the
temple of the Sun-god by that king is surmounted on
the obverse side by a magnificent bas-relief representing
the worship of the Sun-god (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXIVa">XIV</a> and p. 205). The
recovery of this remarkable tablet, apart from the value
attaching to it as a work of art and a historical document,
meant further the identification of one of the earliest
sites of Mesopotamian civilization, and the rediscovery
of the time-honoured shrine of Shamash. Among the
other inscriptions unearthed on this occasion, the large
clay cylinders of Nabonidus (555-538 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), the last king
of the Neo-Babylonian Dynasty, are of paramount importance.
Allusion has already been made to the tradition
recorded by Nabonidus on his cylinder regarding
the date of Shar-Gâni-sharri of Agade, and his son
Narâm-Sin, and also to the archæological evidence calculated
to diminish the historical value of Nabonidus&#8217;
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 61</span>record (cf. p. <a href="#Page_5">5</a>). Rassam reconnoitred many other
sites in Babylonia, notably that of Tellô, from which he
recovered a few objects, including a number of tablets
and two gate-sockets inscribed with the name of Gudea,
during his swift and somewhat stealthy visit in the early
part of 1879. But the three great triumphs of the excavator
whose long career came to its natural end in
1910, were the identification of Sippar&#8217;s long-forgotten
site, the discovery of the bronze gates at Balâwât, and
last but far from least, the unearthing of Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s
northern palace at Nineveh, and the disclosure of the
priceless relics of art and literature which it was found to
contain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile other nations besides the French and the
English were preparing themselves for the work so remarkably
commenced, and so full of promise for the
future. Germany was slow to move, but thanks to
the munificence of Mr. L. Simon, an expedition was
sent out to the Orient in the autumn of 1886, under
the auspices of the Royal Prussian Museums of Berlin,
and under the directorship of B. Moritz, R. Koldewey
and L. Meyer. But in spite of the tardiness of
German activity in the field of exploration, it must
never be forgotten that to Friedrich Delitzsch belongs
the unique honour and glory of having placed Assyriology
upon a scientific basis, and in a real sense that
distinguished scholar may be regarded as the father of
that science. At the same time Delitzsch&#8217;s predecessor
Schrader deserves a special mention, as being the first
to lecture in Germany on this subject, and to whose
lectures Delitzsch and other scholars doubtless owed
much. The 1886 expedition commenced operations
early in 1887 at the ruins of El-Hibba and Surghul,
two mounds situated close to each other to the north-east
of Tellô, which resulted in the discovery of buildings
innumerable, mostly of a private character; the
small relics yielded by the German excavations on these
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 62</span>two sites were for the most part considerably damaged by
fire which had played much havoc in both places.</p>

<p>But the chief point of interest in regard to the excavations
at El-Hibba and Surghul was the discovery
of a number of early graves. Many of the bodies had
been burnt, from which Koldewey inferred that cremation<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
was one of the ways in which the Sumerians of
antiquity disposed of their dead. Many of the inscriptions
recovered were published by the lately deceased
Dr. Messerschmidt. The tablets in question include
texts belonging both to first and second Dynasties of
Lagash (Tellô). One of the tablets unearthed at
Surghul and written by Gudea, the most famous ruler
of the Second Dynasty of Lagash, showed that both
El-Hibba and Surghul acknowledged Gudea as their
suzerain-overlord.</p>

<p>At about the same time, the excavating spirit in
America was also gradually fanning itself into life, and
to-day America is doing more archæological work than
any other country in the world.</p>

<p>The ancient city of Nippur had long been known as
one of the most famous centres of Babylonian religion,
and of the worship of the great god En-lil, and it was
accordingly to this city that the Americans first directed
their attention, and it was here that they made those
epoch-making discoveries which have won for them so
prominent a place in the history of Mesopotamian excavation,
and that in spite of all the controversies which
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 63</span>have arisen out of those discoveries. The Americans
had indeed sent out an expedition to Babylonia as
early as 1884 under the directorship of Dr. W. Hayes
Ward of the New York &#8220;Independent,&#8221; but the object
for which it was sent was general exploration rather than
for actual excavation. The first expedition (1888-89)
to Nippur, which was organized chiefly by Prof. J. P.
Peters, who was supported by Dr. Wm. Pepper, Provost
Harrison, Messrs. E. W. Clay, C. H. Clark, W. W.
Frazier, and others, was chiefly tentative in character,
and served rather to show the magnitude of the work
to be accomplished than to achieve any definite and
practical results. Peters was the director of the first
and second (1889-90) expeditions, while Prof. R. F.
Harper and Prof. H. V. Hilprecht were appointed
Assyriologists to the first expedition, Mr. Field being
the architect. The first expedition was engaged in excavating
for two months and nine days, while the second
excavated for three months and eleven days. Dr. Haynes
was the field-director of the third expedition (1893-96),
and remained at the mounds of Nippur for nearly three
years without a break. The fourth expedition (1898-1900)
was conducted by Hilprecht as scientific director,
Haynes as field-director, and Messrs. C. S. Fisher and
H. V. Geere as architects, and during the last campaign
excavations were carried on for some sixteen months,
and led to many important discoveries.</p>

<p>The first expedition, as stated, was of a preparatory
character, and consequently its results cannot be estimated
merely by the number of discoveries actually
made. During the short two months in which the excavators
continued operations, a large building characterized
by enormous buttresses and two round towers
was brought to light. The building&#8212;without doubt a
fortress&#8212;is of comparatively late date, belonging to
the Parthian period, and was built upon the ancient
temple of En-lil and its staged tower.</p>
<p><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 64</span></p>
<p>Bint-el-Amir, the mound which contained the ruins
of this renowned temple, was conical in shape and covered
a surface of more than eight acres.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> A scientific
examination of a mound of such gigantic proportions
was in itself no light task, while the exploration of the
buried temple was a work of pioneering, none of the
large Babylonian temples having as yet been completely
excavated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Excavations in the Temple Court: Nippur</span><br />

(<i>From C. S. Fisher&#8217;s &#8220;Excavations at Nippur,&#8221; by permission</i>)</p></div>

<p>The excavation of this temple proved that the stage-tower
&#8220;did not occupy the central part of the temple-court,&#8221;
and though it was undoubtedly the most conspicuous
feature of the temple-area, it was not actually
the temple itself: the latter is to be found in a large
building adjacent to the stage-tower. This building is
at all events as early as the time of the Shar-Gâni-sharri
and his son Narâm-Sin. The stage-tower, which probably
never had more than three stages, owed its latest form to
Ur-Engur, king of Ur (<i>circ.</i> 2400), though Ashur-bani-pal,
King of Assyria nearly two thousand years after, had
occasion to repair and restore it. The bricks of Ashur-bani-pal,
which are intermingled with those of Ur-Engur,
bear the stamped inscription, &#8220;To Bel, the King of the
lands, his King, Ashur-bani-pal, his favourite shepherd,
the powerful King, King of the four quarters of the earth,
built E-kur, his beloved temple, with baked bricks.&#8221;
Four feet behind the facing-wall of Ur-Engur, large
bricks characteristic of Narâm-Sin&#8217;s time were discovered,
while the bricks of which the innermost core of
the tower was formed belong to the pre-Sargonic and
early Sumerian days.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The extreme antiquity of the lower strata in this
mound may be gauged from the fact that Haynes in
descending into the pre-Sargonic period below the
pavement of Narâm-Sin, penetrated through some thirty
feet of ruins before he arrived at the virgin soil.</p>

<p><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 65</span></p>

<p>One of the most interesting discoveries in the early
strata was a vaulted drain (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig15">15</a> and p. 170) which
purports to be the earliest Babylonian arch known, while
a large number of terra-cotta pipes as well as a terra-cotta
drain were also brought to light. The smaller objects
include votive stelæ (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>), tablets, cylinder-seals
and terra-cotta vases (cf. Figs. <a href="#fig92">92</a>, <a href="#fig92">93</a>). But a large
number of relics contained in the strata above the level
of Narâm-Sin were found to be pre-Sargonic in spite
of their position in the mound. They included door-sockets,
fragments of vases, slabs, statues, and more
than fifty brick-stamps, bearing an inscription of Sargon
or Narâm-Sin.</p>

<p>But the discovery and partial excavation of the Temple
&#8220;Library&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> or &#8220;archive&#8221; at Nippur have produced
the most far-reaching and epoch-making results, for
thereby literally thousands of tablets have been unearthed,
affording an amount of new material for Assyriological
study seldom paralleled in the history of Babylonian
exploration.</p>

<p>The greater part of the excavated material<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> is scientific
or literary in character. The majority of the tablets
are unbaked, and have consequently suffered from the
detrimental effects of time, climate and other influences,
among which may be particularly mentioned the havoc
wrought by the invading Elamites during the third millennium
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> In consequence of this, the decipherer&#8217;s task
is much more arduous than it would otherwise have
been, but in spite of the vandalism of the Elamites and
the work of destruction which they sought to, and to
some extent did accomplish, the archæologist probably
owes the preservation of these tablets to their burial in
the ruined débris of which they formed a part. These
unbaked clay tablets seem to have been generally arranged
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 66</span>on shelves made of clay and about 1-1/2 feet wide, while
they contain every variety of &#8220;literature,&#8221; treating of
astronomy, astrology, mathematics, geography, history,
medicine, grammar and religion. One of the tablets
gives us valuable information regarding the temple itself;
the name of the great hall of the temple was Emakh,
and though En-lil and his consort were without
doubt the principal deities of the place, there were some
twenty-four shrines dedicated to other gods, just as was
the case in E-sagila, the great Temple of Marduk at
Babylon, recently excavated by the Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft.</p>

<p>The late Assyrian, neo-Babylonian and Persian
periods are also well represented in the enormous accumulation
of cuneiform tablets recovered from this site,
among the most interesting of which are the &#8220;Murashû
Tablets,&#8221; seven hundred or more of which were unearthed
in a ruined building some twenty feet below
the surface. The care with which these tablets had been
made, and the numerous seal-impressions which they
bore, at once attracted Hilprecht&#8217;s attention. They
proved to belong to the business archives of Murashû
Sons, brokers and bankers at Nippur, who flourished in
the time of the Persian kings, Artaxerxes I (<span class="smcap">464-424
B.C.</span>) and Darius II (423-405 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). But apart from ordinary
banking business, the firm acted as an agent for the
Persian kings. Apparently the kings of Persia were in the
habit of farming out the taxes like the Roman emperors
of later days, and Murashû Sons undertook to levy the
king&#8217;s taxes from their Babylonian subjects in Nippur
and elsewhere. The interest of these tablets is not however
confined to the information which they afford us
in regard to the mode of conducting business at that
period; but they are of even greater value for the insight
which they give us into the ordinary life of the
people.</p>

<p>It was during the last expedition that the city-walls
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 67</span>were carefully examined, and also those which enclosed
the temple-area, the name of the former being Nîmit-Marduk
and the name of the latter Imgur-Marduk.
Access to the temple was gained by a gate in the southern
wall, which was at all events as old as the time of Shar-Gâni-sharri
of Agade. The &#8220;Abullu Rabu,&#8221; the great
gate of the city, was situated to the north-east of the
Temple; its length is 35 feet, by which we know that
that was the thickness of the wall itself, though unfortunately
nothing remains of the old city-wall at this
point, the crude bricks of which it was composed having
been removed and used for building materials in
the later Nippur structures. The gateway itself consisted
of a central road some 13 feet wide used for ordinary
traffic, on either side of which was a raised passage
for pedestrians, while the whole structure was built
of thumb-marked bricks, and is therefore pre-Sargonic.
Under the central roadway a foundation consisting of
massive blocks of stone laid in bitumen was discovered.
Some distance north of this gate a large part of the old
city wall was discovered, belonging in the main to the
times of Narâm-Sin and Ur-Engur respectively, the
work of the latter king being of course superimposed on
that of Narâm-Sin. Traces of some hundred feet of
the wall of Narâm-Sin are still visible, and also a water-conduit
consisting of baked bricks laid in bitumen. The
wall was rebuilt by Ur-Engur, who adorned its outer
face with a series of panels 11 feet in width, and placed
at intervals of 30 feet, of which some seventeen were
found in their original positions; the excavators were
unable to ascertain the thickness of the wall, but in one
place it was found preserved to the thickness of over 25
feet. Into the inner face of this later wall were built a
number of small chambers in which were found relics
of varying interest; a description of the later Parthian
fortress, and of the little Parthian palace discovered on
the other side of the Shatt-en-Nîl Canal, would treat
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 68</span>of a period with which this volume does not profess
to deal, and the reader must accordingly refer to the
standard works of some of the excavators themselves
(Peters, Hilprecht or Fisher) for information concerning
these later buildings, as also for details regarding all
the structures and discoveries at Nippur. Sufficient
however has perhaps been recounted to indicate the
extraordinary importance with which the American expeditions
to Nippur have been fraught, though even
to-day we are not in a position to adequately appreciate
the full value of the self-sacrificing labours of the excavators,
and the ample results with which those labours
have been and are daily being attended.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Turks themselves, alive to the importance
of the monuments and relics recovered from
the ruined mounds which ever since Rassam&#8217;s departure
from Baghdad in 1882 had been exploited with
considerable success by the agents of antiquity-dealers,
determined to send out an expedition of their own.
The expedition was placed under the directorship of
Father Scheil, a young French Assyriologist, and Bedri
Bey, the Ottoman Inspector of Antiquities, who commenced
operations in the spring of 1894 at Abû Habba
(Sippar), the site which had been the particular hunting
ground of the dealers, and which therefore was calculated
to be worth scientifically exploring. The most
important result of the expedition was the discovery of
about seven hundred tablets, mostly letters or contracts
belonging to the time of the first Babylonian dynasty,
and especially to the reign of Samsu-iluna, the son and
successor of Khammurabi. In 1891 Dr. Wallis Budge
excavated the neighbouring mound of Dêr and recovered
many texts, etc.; these are now in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>On March 26th, 1899, Dr. Koldewey, whose excavations
at El-Hibba and Surghul had been more than
successful, commenced operations on the &#7730;asr mound
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 69</span>at Babylon, the mound which marks the site of the
world-famed palace of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>The German excavations at Babylon undertaken by
Koldewey, Meissner, Andrae and M. L. Meyer, have
not indeed yielded so rich a harvest as was expected
from the important part which that city played in the
history of the country, from the time of Khammurabi
onwards, for Sennacherib&#8217;s destruction of the city in
689 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> had been carried out with such rigour that
little was left to tell the tale of Babylon&#8217;s greatness
before his time, that little consisting chiefly of contract-tablets
belonging to the time of the First Dynasty, and a
number of pot-burials belonging to a yet earlier period.
But however greatly we must regret the dearth of material
yielded by Babylon&#8217;s ruined mounds, for the reconstruction
of her earlier history, of the period during which she
was at the height of her power,&#8212;the period of the great
king Nebuchadnezzar (604-561 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>)&#8212;the German excavations
have afforded us much valuable information.
The &#7730;asr mound which was found to conceal the remains
of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s famous palace, the palace in which
he lived during the greater part of his reign and the
same one in which Alexander the Great died, seems to
have been a new suburb of Babylon, and contained
nothing earlier than the seventh century. The massive
city-wall, which in all was found to be some 136 feet
in thickness, was discovered, and the palace of Nebuchadnezzar
in part excavated, but the two most important
discoveries of the summer of 1899 were a stele
of dolerite and a sandstone bas-relief. The stele of
dolerite is 4 feet 2 inches high, and on the smooth side
of it the figure of a Hittite god is depicted, while the
reverse contains a Hittite inscription. The god has his
two arms raised and brandishes a trident in one hand,
a large hammer in the other, while a sword hangs
from his side. A long plait of hair hangs down his
back, his head-gear being a Phrygian cap, his footwear
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 70</span>the pointed shoes so characteristically Hittite, and his
tunic, decorated with a fringe, reaches just to the knees.
The second discovery consisted in a sandstone slab
rather over 4 feet long and about 4-1/2 feet in height,
showing in relief a group of figures of which the two
most noteworthy are the god Adad, armed with two
flashes of lightning in either hand, and the goddess
Ishtar.</p>

<p>In the following year Koldewey was able to give
more detailed information regarding the general plan
and arrangement of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s palace. The
palace contained a great number of rooms, arranged
around larger central courts. The walls of the various
buildings rest upon a massive foundation composed of
bricks and fragments. Upon this foundation-platform
a rampart-wall running east to west, over 56 feet thick
and pierced with a single gateway, was discovered,
while at the corner of this wall, another building, older
than the wall itself, was brought to light. This building
was made of burnt brick and asphalt, the bricks
themselves bearing an Aramaic inscription and a walking
lion.</p>

<p>On the east front of the &#7730;asr in Babylon the paving-stones
of the street are made of white limestone, or red
and white breccia, but the only part of the street paving
found in its original position is the layer of burnt
bricks covered with asphalt which served as a foundation
for the stone pavement above. The enormous
limestone blocks measure over 3 feet square and about
13-1/2 inches thick. On some of these limestone blocks an
inscription was found giving Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s name,
and stating that he had paved the Babel street for the
procession of the great lord Marduk with &#8220;mountain-stone&#8221;
slabs. The breccia slabs, none of which have
been recovered complete, were apparently of more modest
dimensions, being only about 26 inches square and
8 inches thick. There is no doubt that these are the
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 71</span>paving-stones wherewith Nebuchadnezzar paved the
&#8220;Processional street of Marduk&#8221; the locus of which is
now certain. Breccia had been used for building purposes
before the time of Nebuchadnezzar: thus we know
that Nabopolassar, the founder of the Neo-Babylonian
Dynasty, had used it for paving the processional street,
while at the Amran mound a block of breccia was found
bearing an inscription of Sennacherib.</p>

<p>The discovery of the processional street of Marduk
was of the greatest importance in regard to the topography
of ancient Babylon, while the confirmation of
the theory held by Delitzsch and others&#8212;hitherto based
chiefly on inferences drawn from Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s texts&#8212;in
the identification of Marduk&#8217;s temple, E-sagila,
with the old Babylonian building concealed within the
Amran mound, during the excavations of May 1900,
was of even greater moment.</p>

<p>Koldewey was further fortunate enough to discover
a temple erected in honour of the goddess Nin-makh
(Great Lady), who was at all events in later times identified
with Ishtar.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> The importance of the discovery
lay in the completeness of the building, and not in the
magnitude of its dimensions, for it is quite small. During
the excavation of this temple a well-preserved Assyrian
cylinder was found, on which Ashur-bani-pal records
that he has newly built Nin-makh&#8217;s temple in Babylon, in
return for which act of piety he clearly expected a rich
reward, for he begs the &#8220;sublime Nin-makh to look
down compassionately&#8221; on his pious deeds, to pronounce
his prosperity daily before Bêl and Bêlit, to prescribe
a &#8220;life of many days as his fate,&#8221; and to establish
his government firmly.</p>

<p>Another interesting discovery was that of a terra-cotta
figure of a naked goddess, doubtless a relic of the
Nin-makh-cult (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig86">86</a>).</p>

<p><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 72</span></p>

<p>The excavations on the Amran hill revealed the presence
of buildings prior to the time of Nebuchadnezzar.
The upper strata of the mound belong for the
most part to the Parthian and Seleucidian times, but at
a depth of 68 feet below the surface of the mound,
the floor of a Babylonian building was uncovered, and
the clay walls of this building, which were over 9 feet
thick, were still found in position to a considerable
height. The floor itself was made of burnt bricks covered
with asphalt, apparently only the bricks in the
uppermost layer bearing the impress of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s
stamp, in consequence of which it seems probable
that the foundation of the building was laid before that
king&#8217;s time. Underneath the lowest flooring a solid
foundation of brick some 6-1/2 feet thick was found. On
the uppermost flooring various objects of interest were
brought to light, including a thin plate of gold, a silver
knob, a gold ear-ring, and fragments of engraved shells.
But the real importance of the excavations at the Amran
mound centres round the discovery of Marduk&#8217;s
famous temple&#8212;E-sagila, the meaning of which is &#8220;the
house of heaven and earth.&#8221; The temple was founded
by King Zabum during the time of the First Dynasty
of Babylon (<i>circ.</i> 2000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), the period, that is to say,
during which the city of Babylon became the most
powerful city-state in Southern Mesopotamia. But the
supremacy of Babylon meant the supremacy of Babylon&#8217;s
god, and the prestige to which Marduk attained
at this time is shown by his identification with Bêl, the
ancient god of Nippur. But some few hundred years
afterwards, when the power and influence of Babylon
had decreased, and dominion in the Mesopotamian Valley
had passed to the more warlike Assyrians in the
north, E-sagila and her god suffered with the people of
Babylon, the temple being looted and the god Marduk
carried off by Tukulti-Ninib, King of Assyria (<i>circ.</i>
1275 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) Some six centuries later found the Assyrians
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 73</span>still all-powerful, though always engaged in suppressing
rebellions among the discontented Babylonian
princes, until at last Sennacherib resolved to wipe out
Babylon from off the face of the earth. E-sagila shared
in the general catastrophe, and but little remains of the
early city or of the temple of her time-honoured god,
though fortunately various documents, vessels and other
relics belonging to the time before Sennacherib escaped
that king&#8217;s fury, and have been recovered recently by
the German excavators. Esarhaddon however, the successor
of Sennacherib, and one of the most humane of
Assyrian monarchs,&#8212;which is not perhaps saying a very
great deal&#8212;made it his special business to rebuild the
city of Babylon and the temple of her god, but he did
not live to see the realization of his project, and the
completion of the work was thus left to Esarhaddon&#8217;s
joint successors, Ashur-bani-pal and Shamash-shum-ukîn.
The temple was roofed with cedar and cypress-wood, and
was rich with gold, silver and precious stones.
When all was finished, Marduk&#8217;s home-coming was
celebrated with great pomp and splendour, Shamash the
sun-god, Ea, Marduk&#8217;s venerable father, Nebo his illustrious
son&#8212;even Nergal the god of the dead, came to
welcome the exiled deity back. But magnificent as was
the reconstruction of Marduk&#8217;s ancient fane by Ashur-bani-pal,
Assyria&#8217;s mightiest king, it was surpassed by
that of Babylon&#8217;s native kings&#8212;Nabopolassar (625-604)
and his son Nebuchadnezzar. Ashur-bani-pal does not
seem to have rebuilt the temple-tower, which Sennacherib
had of course destroyed, but Nabopolassar reared
once more the lofty stage-tower&#8212;the E-temen-an-ki
(&#8220;house of the foundations of heaven and earth&#8221;), and
Nebuchadnezzar his son carried on the laudable work.
He built the walls of the chamber Ekua of pure gold,
while the roof he made of cedar-wood which he covered
with gold and precious stones, the sanctuaries of Nebo
and Zarpanit being treated in the same luxurious manner,
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 74</span>while all the sacrificial vessels seem to have been
made of pure gold. Neriglissar (559-556 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) a successor
of Nebuchadnezzar further built four gates to
this temple,and when the city was finally taken by Cyrus,
it will be recalled that that king made obeisance to Marduk,
at whose behests he professed to have taken the
city&#8212;&#8220;He (Marduk) sought out a righteous prince, a
man after his own heart, whom he might take by the
hand; and he called his name Cyrus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Various graves were discovered in the course of the
excavations at Babylon, but mostly of a late date. A very
interesting sarcophagus was brought to light in 1910,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
the &#8220;head&#8221; end of the terra-cotta cover of which bore in
relief the bearded head of a man with long hair, and
an Egyptian type of face. Two other sarcophagi were
found at the same time, and all of these burials were inside
ruined houses.</p>

<p>Of the many other important results attending the
labours of Koldewey and his confrères, the discovery of
the ancient canal Arakhtu, the tracing of its quay-walls,
the excavation of the great wall between the north and
south castles, and the clearing of the west wall of the
southern citadel, are especially deserving of mention,
while for details the reader must refer to the <i>Mitteilungen
der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft</i>.</p>

<p>But Babylon was not the only site in Lower Mesopotamia
to receive the attention of the Germans on this
expedition. On June 14th, 1902, Koldewey, Delitzsch
and Baumgarten, with a party of labourers, took a boat
down the Euphrates, arriving eventually at the ruined
mounds of Fâra on the 18th. Digging was commenced
in the northern part of the ruin, and it was very soon
evident that the whole site is of very ancient date, not
even the uppermost strata of the mounds containing
anything that can be assigned to a late period. Various
implements of bone and stone, including a number of
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 75</span>stone hatchets, as well as saws and knives made of flint
or obsidian, all testified to the antiquity of its occupation,
and as nothing was discovered at a greater depth
than 6 to 7 feet, Fâra promised at the outset to be one of
the most important sites for the study of early Sumerian
civilization. The ruined mounds of other long-forgotten
cities had indeed yielded relics of the past quite as
old as those excavated at Fâra, but in nearly every case
the upper strata of such mounds were found to contain
the remains of a later date and a more recent occupation;
Fâra however stands unique in this respect, as for
some reasons unknown, it appears only to have been
occupied in the earliest period of Babylonia&#8217;s history,
during which it undoubtedly &#8220;had its day,&#8221; but has
ever since &#8220;ceased to be&#8221; until the German excavators
have at last rescued it from permanent oblivion. Among
the smaller objects discovered on this site, was a number
of seal-cylinders, the majority of which were made of
alabaster, though sometimes of shells, but very rarely of
the hard stones so frequently employed in later days.
They were found sometimes amid the general débris,
sometimes in the tombs; for the most part they exhibit
battle-scenes, the combatants being either men, beasts,
or mythical monstrosities, as the case may be. The
simpler specimens of the pottery found resemble those
unearthed by Koldewey at Surghul, while others were
more elaborately decorated. A few tablets were unearthed,
mostly round in shape, and all of them inscribed
in archaic characters. The citizens of Fâra placed the
bodies of their dead either in clay sarcophagi, or else in
reed mats. The clay sarcophagi are oval in shape, and
about six feet in length; the sides are perpendicular, and
they are closed with a clay cover. The corpse was generally
found lying on its side with the legs drawn up
embryonic-wise, as was the case in pre-Dynastic Egypt,
and one of the hands is holding to the mouth a cup
made of stone, shell, copper, or clay, an incidental proof
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 76</span>of the Babylonian&#8217;s belief in the reality of the life after
death even at this remote period. The tombs of the
better classes contain also the implements, weapons and
ornaments of the deceased. The arms include spears,
poniards and hatchets made of &#8220;bronze&#8221; (?), the jewelry
taking the form of chains, the beads of which are in the
case of the more wealthy made of lapis lazuli, and agate,
while the poorer folk had to content themselves with
ordinary glass. Bracelets and rings of silver and bronze
were also discovered, together with &#8220;bronze&#8221; staffs provided
with lapis-points at either end. Among the tools
may be enumerated fishing-hooks and hatchets made of
&#8220;bronze,&#8221; while colour-boxes made of alabaster or shell
were usually buried with the corpse, and were therefore
presumably regarded as toilet requisites in the life beyond
just as in the life which now is. The colours in most
cases were found well preserved, the principal of which
were black, yellow, red and light green. Many stone vessels
of varying sizes and shapes were brought to light,
most of them being made of alabaster, in fact alabaster
was used quite extensively on this site, contrary to the
usage of the Babylonians of later days, who seldom employed
the softer stones which their Assyrian neighbours
utilized so frequently and for so many divers purposes.
The excavators report that they were unable to determine
whether the sarcophagi or the mat-burials were the
older, both apparently being used synchronously; an
assumption that the sarcophagi were used by the better
classes, the mat-interments by the poorer, would in itself
be sufficiently reasonable, but for the awkward fact that
the mat-graves are as richly provided with the accoutrements,
ornaments and implements of the deceased as
are the sarcophagi themselves. Very few sculptures were
found, most of them being on alabaster and showing
considerable skill in their general execution. The early
part of 1903 was signalized by the discovery of a building
made of well-baked bricks, in the ruined débris of
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 77</span>which were discovered a large number of well-preserved
tablets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile excavations had been carried on at the
same time at the mound of Abû Hatab, Koldewey having
received a report of the discovery of inscribed bricks on
this site. Operations were commenced here on December
24th, 1902, and resulted in the discovery of a number
of small buildings, the walls of which were notable
for their insubstantiality. Some of the bricks were
found to bear an inscription of Bur-Sin, king of Ur
(<i>circ.</i> 2350 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). But Abû Hatab yielded little of interest
to the student of early prehistoric remains. The
tombs here consisted for the most part in two large
pots &#8220;adjusted with their edges in a horizontal position,&#8221;
a form of sarcophagus found also in the early
strata at Babylon and Mu&#7731;eyyer (Ur). The corpse lay
either on its back or side, but in both cases it was contracted,
this being obviously necessitated by the limitations
of the sarcophagus, as was similarly the case in
the early pot-burials of ancient Egypt. A vessel of clay
or copper was generally found placed near the head of
the corpse, doubtless destined to fulfil a purpose similar
to that of the drinking cups found in the graves at
Fâra.</p>

<p>At about this time Andrae, Koldewey&#8217;s assistant,
completed the excavation of the temple of Nebo at Birs-Nimrûd
(Borsippa), whence Nebo paid his yearly visit
to Marduk on the first day of the New Year.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Ziggurat and Palace of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal: Ashur</span><br />
(<i>By permission of the German Oriental Society</i>)</p></div>

<p>Koldewey and Andrae did not however confine their
attention to the ruined mounds of Babylonia, but in
1903 commenced excavations at &#7730;alat Sher&#7731;at, the site
of Ashur, Assyria&#8217;s ancient capital, and the name of
the god from whom Assyria derives her name. As early
as 1852 Sir Henry Layard had conducted excavations
on this site, the chief tangible result of which was the
discovery of Tiglath-Pileser I&#8217;s clay cylinders, though
fragments of bas-reliefs and other inscriptions were also
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 78</span>discovered here both by Layard and Rassam. Shalmaneser
I (<i>circ.</i> 1300 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) had transferred the seat of his
government from Ashur to Calah, but his successor
Tukulti-Ninib (<i>circ.</i> 1275 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) restored the capital of
the empire to Ashur. The mounds which mark the
site of this ancient city are to a great extent of natural
formation (cf. Pl. <a href="#pVIII">VIII</a>), thereby differing from most of
the ruined mounds in Mesopotamia, which owe their
existence to artificial formation. From September 1903
to April 1904 operations were of a tentative character
and consisted of trial trenches, but in April 1904 the
Germans commenced excavating the large mound of
mud-brick, the ziggurat, the eastern plateau, and the
large court of Ashur&#8217;s temple, part of the fortification-wall
also receiving attention, while the main work centred
round the palace-buildings of Shalmaneser I (<i>circ.</i>
1300 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). The great temple of Ashur, built or restored
by Ushpia, an early ruler of the city who antedates
Irishum, is situated in the north-east corner, and
it adjoins the palace of Shalmaneser I. The ziggurat or
stage-tower lies to the west-south-west, and the palace
of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal adjoins the temple of Anu and Adad,
which would appear to be the best preserved building in
Ashur. Various other buildings have been discovered,
of which the temple of Nebo and the palace of Tukulti-Ninib
I (<i>circ.</i> 1275 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) may be specially mentioned.
Numerous graves were found of various kinds, those
with brick walls being undoubtedly Assyrian. Many
valuable historical inscriptions were found, while the
discovery of a wall-decoration consisting of a series of
rosettes was another interesting result. The so-called
&#8220;Mushlala&#8221; of Adad-nirari I (<i>circ.</i> 1325 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), according
to whom it formed a part of the temple of Ashur, was
found to be identical with that restored by Sennacherib
with &#8220;mountain-stone,&#8221; and afterwards repaired by
Esarhaddon (681-668 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) with &#8220;pîlu&#8221;-stone. The
foundations of the building situated at the southern
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 79</span>side of the eastern plateau proved to be of very great
depth, while the plan of the building itself is said to
closely resemble the early Babylonian type. The temple
of Ashur the great lord of Assyria is alluded to by Irishum,
king of Assyria (<i>circ.</i> 2000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), by Shamshi-Adad
who calls himself builder of the temple of Ashur, by
Adad-nirari and by Shalmaneser I. In Shalmaneser I&#8217;s
reign it was destroyed by fire, and that king undertook
its restoration. An inscription of Tiglath-Pileser II informs
us that he decorated the temple with enamelled
bricks. Some of these inscriptions were found &#8220;in
situ&#8221; thus fixing the precise locus of Ashur&#8217;s famous
shrine. The temple was situated at the extreme north
of the city, three of its sides overlooking the open
country and the fourth over-towered by the ziggurat.
Remains of Shalmaneser&#8217;s work have been found in
the foundation and pavement constructed by that king,
and some of the enamelled bricks which decorated the
buildings of Sargon have also been recovered, while
the pavement of the great court, as well as pieces of
enamelled brick and the clay cones of Tiglath-Pileser II
have been brought to light. The temple itself was originally
high above the level of the street. A second
smaller ziggurat was further found, which proved to be
a part of the temple of Anu and Adad, and the work of
three distinct periods has been traced in this structure.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
Of interesting relics here unearthed, we may specifically
mention a three-pronged thunderbolt of wood sheathed
with gold.</p>

<p>The remains of various palaces have been unearthed
including those of Adad-nirari and Shalmaneser I,
and the royal residence of Tukulti-Ninib has been also
excavated. Many tablets were recovered, and a pot
containing 113 unbaked clay tablets was also brought
to light: the tablets are written in a script characteristic
of the time of Tiglath-Pileser I, and are chiefly
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 80</span>concerned with receipts for cattle. Much pottery was
unearthed, together with a variety of objects including
some Roman imperial coins of the second century. The
northern part of the city was that which was favoured
by the Assyrian kings, and accordingly contains the remains
of several temples and palaces, but the ruins of
private houses are perhaps of even greater interest than
the palaces of kings and the abodes of the gods. They
are small in size, but were evidently carefully drained.
Within the houses a number of graves were discovered,
apparently belonging to the same period as the houses
themselves. In many cases the excavators state that
they found clear traces of cremation in the graves. Seven
distinctly different kinds of graves were found at Ashur&#8212;vaults,
clay sarcophagi, baked clay trays placed over the
corpse, jars, brick graves, potsherd graves, and earth
graves. The vaults<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> are of various shapes and dimensions,
are made of burnt brick, and consist generally of a fairly
spacious chamber and an entrance shaft. The bodies&#8212;always
more than one in each vault&#8212;lay on the floor in
a contracted position, surrounded with drinking vessels
of every description, and in all cases there was a small
niche for a lamp. The clay sarcophagi show even greater
varieties, including jars into which the bodies were
pressed, and tubs both high and short into which the
corpse was placed in a seated position, while both of
these classes comprise many different types.</p>

<p>Another class of jar-burial, known as the &#8220;capsule,&#8221;
consisted in two jars drawn over the feet and head respectively
and pressed together till they met, thus forming
a &#8220;capsule.&#8221; The Brick-graves were practically
Brick-sarcophagi, the graves being built coffin-wise, but
few of these have been found. The Potsherd graves
are so called from the use of potsherds to cover the
corpse. Apparently these various methods of burial coexisted
at the same time, and they accordingly cannot
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 81</span>be classified into periods, as is the case to some extent in
early Egypt.</p>

<p>Concerning the fortifications of the city, the inscriptions
of the various kings who built, repaired, or rebuilt
these, afford us a good deal of information, but the excavations
themselves have not up to the present told us
as much as we could desire. Shalmaneser II&#8217;s work of restoration
on the southern wall has been identified by the
clay-cones of that king found in the upper part of the
wall, while in some of his inscriptions Shalmaneser calls
himself the builder of the &#8220;Dûru&#8221; itself. The quay-wall
built by Adad-nirari I, restored by Adad-nirari II, and
later on by Adad-nirari III, has been excavated for nearly
490 yards of its length; it is built of blocks of limestone
and is faced with brick on the river-side, coherency
being added to the whole by an ample employment of
asphalt and clay-mortar. Part of the city-moat built by
Tukulti-Ninib I has also been found, the excavations
having further revealed the restoration of the city-wall,
for which Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal was probably responsible.</p>

<p>The year 1908 saw the excavation of the temple
erected in honour of the god Nebo at Ashur by Sin-shar-ishkun,
the last king of Assyria (<i>circ.</i> 615 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>).<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
The general ground-plan of this late Assyrian temple
was found to correspond to that of the Anu-Adad
temple, and also to that of the temple built by Sargon
at Khorsabad.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Numerous stelæ and other monuments
of stone were recovered from the ruins of Ashur; they
include a basalt stele of Tukulti-Ninib,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> a stele of Tiglath-Pileser
III, and another of Ashur-resh-ishi II,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> a
limestone stele of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal, an alabaster stele
with the representation of a king adoring a god and
goddess, which in some way resembles the Bavian relief
of Sennacherib,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> and fragments of a diorite sculpture<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 82</span>with small figures recalling the style of art characteristic
of the Khammurabi period. The interest of
these monuments is chiefly centred in the inscriptions
which throw new light upon the number and order of
the Assyrian kings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Americans, whose excavations in
Babylonia had been inaugurated with so much promise,
had again taken the field. On Christmas day 1903 an
expedition sent out by the Oriental Exploration Fund
of the University of Chicago, under the directorship of
Professor R. F. Harper (E. J. Banks as field-director)
commenced excavations at Bismâya, the name of a
group of mounds situated between the Tigris and
Euphrates, and due south of Bagdad. The mounds are
very extensive, measuring about a mile in length and
half a mile in breadth, but their altitude is very low
compared with that of other mounds, such as Erech,
Nippur (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXa">X</a>) or Borsippa. The temple was the
first building at Bismâya to receive attention, partly
owing to the fact that it happened to be concealed beneath
one of the loftiest of the Bismayân mounds, and
partly because the general shape of the mound suggested
the possible existence of a stage-tower beneath its ruined
débris. Trenches dug on all sides of the mound towards
the centre soon revealed the lower storey of one
of these temple towers, the second storey of which had
disappeared, though some of the burnt bricks which
formed its outer casing were found lying about. The
surviving lower stage consisted in crude bricks and clay,
but was provided with a facing of burnt brick some four
feet thick. Many of these casing bricks were inscribed
with the name of Dungi, king of Ur (<i>circ.</i> 2400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>).
Beneath the bricks of Dungi was found another layer
of burnt bricks, some of which bore the name of Ur-Engur,
Dungi&#8217;s immediate predecessor on the throne
of Ur. Of small objects unearthed, the three most interesting
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 83</span>were a thin strip of gold found about two feet
below the baked bricks of Dungi, and bearing the name
of the renowned Nârâm-Sin, the son of Shar-Gâni-sharri
of Agade, and the second was a small white marble
statuette found at no great distance from the strip of
gold, and conforming to the style of art characteristic
of the age of Narêm-Sin, while the third was another
marble statue belonging to the earliest Sumerian period,
and closely resembling those excavated in the lowest
strata at Tellô (Lagash). This statue (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig32">32</a>) is
probably unique as a statue in the round belonging to
so early a period, and is especially noticeable for the fact
that the arms are in this case entirely free from the
body, and carved altogether in the round.</p>

<p>Just below the place where the gold of Narâm-Sin was
recovered, large bricks about 18 inches square and belonging
to the age of Shar-Gâni-sharri were found, while
numerous inscriptions of this same king were forthcoming
from some of the other mounds at Bismâya.
Beneath the large Sargonic bricks there was a layer of
thin oblong and finger-marked bricks, while lower still,
some five feet below the surface, small plano-convex
bricks set in bitumen were brought to light.</p>

<p>A great number of vase fragments made of marble,
porphyry, granite, alabaster and onyx, together with innumerable
objects made of ivory, mother of pearl, metal
and stone were found round about the temple tower.</p>

<p>In regard to the temple itself, an entrance was discovered
on the south-east side, the principal remaining
features of which were the marble gate-socket supported
on two slabs of pink marble. At the south corner, an
oval-shaped room was brought to light, which was once
covered with a dome-shaped roof. But the base of the
temple tower had depths even below the stratum containing
the small plano-convex bricks, which yet remained
to be fathomed.</p>

<p>Some sixteen or seventeen feet below the surface a
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 84</span>large metal spike (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig40">40</a>) terminating in a lion&#8217;s
head was recovered, while much lower still, about
thirty-nine to forty feet below the level of the mound a
number of fragments of wheel-made black pottery were
revealed. The date of this wheel-made pottery is of
course unknown, but judging from the depth at which
it was found, Dr. Banks, the Field-director of the expedition,
suggests a date of 10,000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> In the same
year (1903) in which these successful excavations were
being carried on at Bismâya, Nineveh, the ruined
mounds of which once-famous city had already yielded
such a rich harvest to the great pioneers in the field of
Mesopotamian exploration, received further attention
at the hands of the Trustees of the British Museum,
who sent out an expedition under Messrs. L. W. King
and R. C. Thompson, with a view to the further excavation
of the Kouyunjik mound. The principal result
of the excavations carried on there between the years
1903 and 1905 was the discovery of the site of Nabû&#8217;s
temple, which had however been so ruthlessly destroyed&#8212;presumably
by the Elamites&#8212;that no complete plan
of the temple could be made.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the excavations at Tellô (Lagash) which
had been brought suddenly to an end by the death of
the brilliant French excavator (M. de Sarzec) in May,
1901, were resumed in January, 1903, under the directorship
of Captain Gaston Cros. The principal fresh
discovery made was a massive fortification wall built
by Gudea (<i>circ.</i> 2450 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). It is about thirty-two and
a half feet thick, and in places is still in position to
the height of twenty-six feet. Captain Cros also excavated
a large rectangular building, and brought to light
various objects of interest, including implements of flint
and copper, together with a brick-stamp of Narâm-Sin,
which latter may be regarded as evidence that building
operations were carried on in Lagash by a Semitic king
of Agade during the period of Semitic supremacy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III&#8212;DECIPHERMENT OF THE
CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTIONS</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE first person to bring reports of cuneiform inscriptions
to Europe was Pietro della Valle, an
Italian belonging to a Roman family of noble birth. In
the years 1614-26 he made a journey to Turkey, Egypt,
Palestine, Persia and India, and published an account
of his travels in 1650, but the first communication of
his discovery of cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis
was contained in a letter written from Shiraz and dated
October 21st, 1621. Josafat Barbaro at the end of the
fifteenth century had already taken notice of the strange
signs found on the monuments at Persepolis, but Pietro
della Valle was the first to suspect that the inscriptions
were something more than mere decorative incisions on
the rock. But though Pietro della Valle had made copies
of a few of the inscriptions on the walls of the ruined
palaces of Persepolis as early as 1621, to Chardin (1674)
belongs the honour of making the first copy of a complete
cuneiform inscription, the so-called &#8220;Window-Inscription,&#8221;
the shortest of the trilingual Achaemenian
inscriptions, and his copy is to be found in the account
of his travels (published 1711). This same inscription
was copied in 1694 by Kampfer, who also copied the
Babylonian text of the &#8220;H&#8221; inscription found at Persepolis,
and who was the first to adopt the term &#8220;cuneiform.&#8221;
In the work which he published in 1712 he discusses
whether the unknown script is alphabetic, syllabic,
or ideographic, and decides in favour of the last. In
1701, the Dutchman De Bruin commenced his travels:
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 86</span>he devoted the year 1704 to an examination of the ruins
at Persepolis and ten years later he published two new
trilingual inscriptions in addition to an Old Persian and
a Babylonian inscription, but to copy was one thing and
to decipher was quite another, and well nigh a century
elapsed before any real progress was made towards the
unravelling of these cryptic signs, and the reconstruction
of the languages which they embodied. In 1762
the inscription on the Vase of Xerxes found by Count
Caylus  was published, and a quadrilingual inscription of
this king was published the same year. In 1765 Carsten
Niebuhr, a Dane, copied several Achaemenian inscriptions
at Persepolis, and pointed out that the first of the
three columns on each of the trilingual inscriptions that
had been found, contained only forty-two varieties of
cuneiform characters from which he surmised rightly that
the system in the first column was neither ideographic
(each sign representing a word), nor syllabic (each sign
representing a syllable), but alphabetic. From 1798 onwards,
Tychsen and Münter, also a Dane, carried on
the work begun by Niebuhr, and published their results
in 1802. Münter had correctly guessed that the ubiquitous
diagonal wedge <img src="images/divider.jpg" width="15" height="15" alt="diagonal wedge" />
served to separate the words
from each other, and one word which occurred at the
beginning of each inscription, he rightly adjudged to be
the word for &#8220;king.&#8221; In the meantime the Zend<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> language
of the later Zoroastrian faith had been rediscovered,
and with the aid of it, de Sacy had been able to
decipher the Pehlevi<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> inscriptions. Now only the older
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 87</span>Persian inscriptions of the Achaemenian kings awaited
interpretation. In 1802 G. Friedrich Grotefend, of
Hanover, a schoolmaster by profession, entered the field,
and by the following process of reasoning he became the
pioneer discoverer of part of the Persian cuneiform
alphabet, and the first decipherer of a complete cuneiform
inscription. Old writers had provided him with
the all-important information that the palaces of Persepolis,
amid the ruins of which so many of these cuneiform
inscriptions had been found, were built by the
Achaemenian kings. The Pehlevi inscriptions moreover,
which had also been found on this site and had
been deciphered by de Sacy, led him to expect that the
cuneiform inscriptions would contain something analogous.
Grotefend had already satisfied himself that the
inscriptions read from left to right, and selecting two
short inscriptions, one engraved on a gate-post of a
building on the second palace-terrace, and the other engraved
on the wall of a building on the third palace-terrace
at Persepolis, he commenced his successful investigations.
Both inscriptions contained the group
of signs which Münter had already rightly inferred represented
&#8220;king,&#8221; though what was the Persian for
&#8220;king&#8221; remained as yet unknown, the only difference
being that in Inscription I &#8220;king&#8221; was preceded by
a group of signs which may be conveniently designated
&#8220;X,&#8221; while in Inscription II &#8220;king&#8221; is preceded by
a group of signs which may be called &#8220;Y,&#8221; and that
moreover in Inscription II &#8220;X&#8221; and the word for
&#8220;king&#8221; following it occurred after the &#8220;Y&#8221; + &#8220;king.&#8221;
In I on the other hand &#8220;X&#8221; + &#8220;king&#8221; was followed
by another group of signs which may be labelled &#8220;Z,&#8221;
without however the usual accompanying &#8220;king.&#8221;</p>

<p>
Thus I reads &#8220;X&#8221; + king.........&#8220;Z&#8221;.........<br />
<br />
And II reads &#8220;Y&#8221; + king......... &#8220;X&#8221; + king.<br />
</p>

<p><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 88</span></p>

<p>From this, Grotefend concluded that the groups of
signs &#8220;X&#8221; &#8220;Y&#8221; and &#8220;Z&#8221; represented proper names,
and that as &#8220;X&#8221; and &#8220;Y&#8221; were accompanied by
&#8220;king,&#8221; they must be king&#8217;s names, and lastly Achaemenian
kings&#8217; names, for ancient writers stated that
these palaces at Persepolis were built by Achaemenian
kings, and furthermore their position suggested that
these proper names must stand in genealogical relation
to each other. In I &#8220;X&#8221; must be the son
of &#8220;Z,&#8221; and in II &#8220;Y&#8221; must be the son of &#8220;X&#8221;;
&#8220;X&#8221; and &#8220;Y&#8221; are accompanied with the sign for
&#8220;king,&#8221; &#8220;Z&#8221; is not, therefore &#8220;Z&#8221; the father of &#8220;X&#8221;
is not a king, and consequently &#8220;X&#8221; is presumably the
founder of the dynasty. But apart from this hypothesis,
some of the names of the five kings composing the (fortunately)
short Achaemenian Dynasty&#8212;Cyrus, Cambyses,
Darius, Xerxes and Artaxerxes&#8212;were at once ruled
out of court: thus Cyrus and Cambyses were out of the
question, for &#8220;X&#8221; and &#8220;Y&#8221; did not commence with the
same cuneiform letter (it must be remembered that it
had already been rightly assumed that the system was an
alphabetic one), and moreover Cyrus&#8217; father and son
were both named Cambyses, and accordingly if &#8220;X&#8221;
were Cyrus then &#8220;Y&#8221; and &#8220;Z&#8221; should be the same,
which they are not. Cyrus and Artaxerxes were likewise
disqualified, as there was no such discrepancy in
the length of the words, there thus remained only Darius
and Xerxes to be considered, and as &#8220;X&#8217;s&#8221; father &#8220;Z&#8221;
is not called king, and it is further known that Hystaspes
the father of Darius is not styled &#8220;king&#8221; by
the classical writers, &#8220;X&#8221; was rightly assumed to be
Darius. Having ascertained the oldest forms of the
names of the Achaemenian kings in question from the
classical writers, and Hebrew and Persian literature, he
applied these forms to the groups of cuneiform signs
which he had been led to believe they represented, and
he found the respective groups contained the same
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 89</span>number of individual signs as the proper names in question
contained letters, and for</p>

<p>
&#8220;X&#8221; he accordingly read&#8212;D A R &#8212; &#8212; U SH = Darius<br />
<br />
&#8220;Z&#8221; he read&#8212;G O SH T A S P = Hystaspes<br />
<br />
&#8212; the Zend form of the name.<br />
</p>

<p>But &#8220;Y,&#8221; which on his hypothesis should be Xerxes,
was not quite so easy to explain. He already knew the
values of four or five of the seven signs composing group
&#8220;Y,&#8221; and these known values occurred in the order he
expected, but the first and third signs in the group remained
to be dealt with. Grotefend observed that the
first sign was the same as the first sign of the group
correctly guessed by Münter to represent &#8220;king&#8221;: he
ascertained that the Greek letter &#8220;x&#8221; was transliterated
in the Zend by &#8220;kh,&#8221; and rightly inferred that the
Greek &#8220;x&#8221; commencing the proper name Xerxes would
be similarly transliterated by &#8220;kh&#8221; in old Persian, in
other words that the first sign in the group should be
read &#8220;Kh.&#8221; The result of Grotefend&#8217;s investigations
was the discovery of the correct values for eight letters
in the Persian cuneiform alphabet, the letter &#8220;a&#8221; having
been already rightly read by Tychsen and Münter.
His method of decipherment was proved to be correct
by the quadrilingual vase-inscription already alluded to.
The first version of this latter inscription is written in
Egyptian hieroglyphics and was deciphered by Champollion
as the name of Xerxes. The other three versions
are written in cuneiform characters, the first of
which, the old Persian, gave precisely the same group
of signs as that which Grotefend read as Xerxes on the
inscription from Persepolis. As Sayce<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> well says, the
decipherment of cuneiform and all the far-reaching consequences
resultant from it, depended upon a successful
guess, but a guess made &#8220;in accordance with scientific
method,&#8221; and it was upon Grotefend&#8217;s discovery that all
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 90</span>subsequent attempts to decipher cuneiform&#8212;Persian,
Median, or Assyrian&#8212;were based. But unfortunately,
though Grotefend had thus given the clue, and scented
the track for all future scholars, his own ignorance of
eastern languages prevented him from reaping himself
the full harvest of his brilliant commencement, and the
work so nobly begun was not completed till a later day.</p>

<p>The next great step forward was taken by the French
scholar Emile Burnouf in 1836; he discovered that
one inscription contained a list of the satrapies, and as
the names of the satrapies were known from the Greek
writers he was able on the partial knowledge of the
alphabet already attained, to fit in the names to the
cuneiform signs, and as a result he produced an alphabet
of thirty letters mostly correct. About the same
time Lassen assigned the correct values to almost all
the letters in the alphabet, and further demonstrated
that the language of the inscriptions was akin to the
language of the Zend and also to the Sanskrit, though
identical with neither.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rawlinson had entered the field, and
being attached to the British Mission in Persia, he had
opportunities which others lacked, his position making
it possible for him to copy and on a subsequent occasion
take squeezes<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> of the inscription on the sacred rock of
Behistun, which is filled with proper names. The
French traveller Otter was apparently the first European
to draw attention to the inscribed rock of Behistun,
about the year 1734, and it is also mentioned by Oliver,
but the earliest reference to it is contained in the History
of Diodorus Siculus who flourished in the first century
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> Kinneir who saw it in 1810 states that it is clear
that the figures portrayed there are of the same age and
character as those from Persepolis. In 1818 Porter
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 91</span>made a sketch of the figures, but did not attempt to
copy the inscription in spite of the experience he had
gained in copying the inscription at Persepolis. The
copying of it was no easy task, for Rawlinson had to
be lowered in a basket from the top, the ladders which
he had with him not being long enough to reach the
upper part of the inscription from below. He sent
his copy<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> to Edwin Norris, the secretary of the Royal
Asiatic Society, who carefully revised it, and in 1849
an analysis and commentary on the text was published.
With Rawlinson and Norris must be mentioned the
Irish clergyman Hincks, who with his unrivalled genius
in the decipherment of inscriptions was the first to
discover that the alphabet was not a true one, but that
a vowel-sound was attached to each of the consonants;
and also Beer Holtzman and Westergaard, all of whom
contributed to the work of investigation and made discoveries
in regard to both the grammar and lexicon.
Rawlinson cannot indeed claim to have actually discovered
the first clue which led to the decipherment
of cuneiform, but his translation of the Behistun inscription
was unquestionably the most valuable contribution
ever made towards the unravelling of the old
Persian language. His work was moreover at first
quite independent of Grotefend&#8217;s, and without any assistance
from the latter he had deciphered the names of
Cyrus, Hystaspes and Darius on the inscriptions from
Elvend and Hamadan as early as 1835. Thus the
efforts of half a century resulted at length in the discovery
of a new alphabet and the resurrection of an old
language. The Persian texts on the inscriptions were
accompanied by two other texts, which as Grotefend
divined must have been the two other principal languages
used in the Persian Empire. The third text
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 92</span>closely resembling the inscriptions on bricks and cylinder
seals found in Babylon was naturally and correctly assumed
to be Assyrian.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> The decipherment of this third
transcript was fraught with difficulties of every description;
there was such an endless variety of signs of a
simple and complex order, and there was nothing whatever
to indicate where a word or a sentence started or
finished, and further the characters on the monuments
from Persepolis differed very considerably from those
found on the Babylonian monuments, which also varied
among themselves very greatly. On the seal-cylinders
they were especially complicated, and it was almost impossible
to see any resemblance whatever between the
characters on the latter and those of the Persepolitan
inscriptions.</p>

<p>But light was to come from another quarter: in 1842
Botta, French Consul at Mosul, began excavating on
the site of Nineveh, but not meeting with success he
transferred his operations to Khorsabad further north,
and there excavated a large palace which subsequently
turned out to be that of Sargon. In 1845 Layard entered
the field, and carried on most successful excavations at
Nimrûd (the ancient Calah) and then at Kouyunjik, one
of the mounds which represents the site of Nineveh.</p>

<p>Botta published the inscriptions he had found in
1846-50, and also classified the signs, which numbered
642, while he further demonstrated the identity of the
cuneiform system of the Nineveh inscriptions with that
of the third column on the Persepolitan monuments,
but it was reserved for the incomparable Hincks to discover
the fact that the Assyrian cuneiform system was
syllabic and not alphabetic like the Persian.</p>

<p><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 93</span></p>

<p>The proper names in the Persian columns gave the
first clue to the decipherment of the Assyrian columns.
The values thus obtained for some of the Assyrian signs
made it possible to read many of the words, their meanings
being determined by a comparison with the Persian
columns. It was then seen that Assyrian was a Semitic
language and resembled Hebrew in particular; this was
proved conclusively by De Saulcy in 1849. In 1850
Rawlinson submitted a translation of the inscription on
the Black obelisk of Shalmaneser II to the Royal Asiatic
Society, a translation which was in the main correct,
and in the following year he published the text and
translation of the Assyrian transcript on the Behistun
inscription, and announced two facts, one already known,
namely that the Assyrian signs can be used ideographically,
i.e. to denote an object or idea, as well as to represent
merely a syllable, the other fact was that the
characters were polyphonous, i.e. could represent more
than one syllable each: this was again proved to demonstration
by the redoubtable Hincks. Both facts
alike argued that the cursive Assyrian cuneiform had
its origin in picture writing, for in the latest times when
cuneiform was as it were fully stereotyped, the signs
were still used alone singly to represent an object or an
idea, and also the polyphonous character of the individual
signs testified to the same origin, for example the
picture of an arm would signify not merely an &#8220;arm&#8221;
but also &#8220;strength,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;grasp,&#8221; etc., and thus
though the sign would&#8212;at least originally&#8212;only have
one general idea attached to it, it would have quite a
number of phonetic values: these phonetic values would
in the first be inseparably connected with the root <i>idea</i>,
but in time when the sign had become cursive and
developed and no longer resembled the original picture,
the various phonetic values of the sign would not
necessarily have anything whatever to do with the original
root idea.</p>

<p><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 94</span></p>

<p>For example, a character with the <i>meaning</i> and <i>phonetic</i>
value of the word &#8220;<i>win</i>,&#8221; would in later times come to
represent the syllable &#8220;<i>win</i>&#8221; quite apart from the basis
meaning of the word win, thus the sign could be used
to represent the first syllable in the word <i>win-ter</i>.</p>

<p>In 1857 the Royal Asiatic Society proposed to test
the reliability of the translations put forward by scholars
of the Assyrian inscriptions in the following manner:
some eight hundred lines of cuneiform writing contained
on clay cylinders found by Layard at &#7730;alat Sher&#7731;at, the
ancient Ashur, were to be independently translated by
any scholars who were prepared to accept the proposal;
the translations were to be sent under seal to the society&#8217;s
secretary, and were to be opened together and
examined before a commission on a set day. Rawlinson,
Fox Talbot, Hincks and Oppert entered the lists,
and on May 25th their respective products were opened
and compared. The great similarity which they all displayed
afforded conclusive proof as to the correctness
of the method of decipherment, and demonstrated finally
that the investigations carried on, together with the
results of those investigations, had not been mere speculative
guesses, but were based on sound scientific principles.</p>

<p>Many other scholars deserve our gratitude for the
share they took in the decipherment of the cuneiform
inscriptions, of whom one may perhaps specially name
Westergaarde, Löwenstern, De Saulcy and Longperier,
but for an account of the particular achievements of
each, the reader must refer to general works on the
subject.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV&#8212;CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTIONS</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>LL alphabets and all modes of writing have their
ultimate origin in pictures or hieroglyphs, and
the cuneiform script offers no exception to this universal
rule. When the early pictorial symbols are used
to indicate objects and ideas other than the particular
object of which the symbol is a representation the accuracy
or inaccuracy of the picture becomes a matter of
small importance, and an inevitable tendency to sketch
the picture in the most speedy manner possible ends
finally in the evolution of a purely cursive script. In
Mesopotamia this course of development&#8212;or deterioration&#8212;was
hastened by the nature of the material used
in later times for all ordinary writing purposes, i.e. the
all-abundant clay of the valley, it being impossible to
draw the lines and curves necessary for the production
of pictures on so plastic a substance as clay. The shape
assumed by the signs forming the characters was due
to the same cause, the point at which the stylus first
comes in contact with the soft clay being unavoidably
thicker than the remainder of the stroke which automatically
tapers off into the form of a wedge. But so
forcible is the influence of habit and so strong the imitative
tendency, that we find the cuneiform characters
which owed their wedge-shaped formation entirely and
solely to the adoption of clay as a writing material, faithfully
and slavishly copied on the colossal stone bulls,
stelæ and wall-reliefs of later Assyrian kings.</p>

<p>The early decipherers of cuneiform had no specific
knowledge of its pictographic origin, for all the inscriptions
at that time discovered showed the same stereotyped
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 96</span>and cursive script, but since their day a vast
number of archaic inscriptions have been brought to
light which prove conclusively that cuneiform as such
was no invention of either Semites or Sumerians, but
was simply the last stage in the process of degeneration
to which the early pictures of the pre-Semitic Sumerians
were subject. In the following illustrations (Figs. <a href="#fig1">1</a> and
<a href="#fig2">2</a>) we have a number of characters taken from actual
inscriptions and arranged in order of evolution so to
speak,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> the sign in the left-hand column containing the
most archaic form of the sign as yet discovered, the signs
in the right-hand column showing the gradual transition
to cursive cuneiform, while the last sign in the column
is the ordinary late Assyrian ideograph. Thus in &#8220;A&#8221;
we have the crude picture of a man recumbent, and one
can follow the course of its development or deterioration
from the various forms it has assumed on monuments
and bricks arranged in order of sequence. Given
the ordinary cuneiform sign for &#8220;man&#8221; by itself, it
would be quite impossible to conjecture that it originated
in the picture of a man at all. Below (&#8220;B&#8221;) we have
the old Sumerian hieroglyph for &#8220;king,&#8221; consisting in
a man lying down, surmounted by either a crown or an
umbrella as part of the insignia of royalty. In &#8220;C&#8221; we
have the picture of a man&#8217;s head in recumbent posture,
the lips being represented by two slanting lines, while
the series of characters in the centre illustrates the various
forms the sign has assumed on the bricks and
monuments, and the arrangement shows the process
whereby the original hieroglyph gradually discarded all
trace of its pictorial origin, and became a cursive stereotyped
sign the principal value of which is &#8220;mouth.&#8221;
Below we have another rude picture of a man&#8217;s head,
but on this occasion he wears a beard, which would
suggest a full-grown man; hence the meaning of the
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 97</span>Assyrian ideograph is &#8220;strength,&#8221; &#8220;be strong,&#8221; or &#8220;protection.&#8221;
In figure &#8220;E&#8221; there is a representation of a
potted plant: this sign, instead of becoming simpler as
it makes each progressive step towards cuneiform, becomes
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 98</span>paradoxically more complex, until it finally subsides
and assumes its normal cursive form, the principal
value for which is &#8220;cypress-tree.&#8221; Below (&#8220;F&#8221;) two
plants are seen, growing likewise in a pot: the progress
is again obvious, the meanings of the ideogram being
&#8220;plant&#8221; and &#8220;garment&#8221;; this latter meaning is probably
attached to the sign through the use of flax as a material
for clothing. &#8220;G&#8221; appears to be a tree growing by water;
the late cuneiform sign has numerous values, but none
of them suggest any immediate connection with the
obvious signification of the picture-character from which
it was developed. &#8220;H&#8221; gives us a picture of a reed, the
late cuneiform character being the ideogram for &#8220;kanu&#8221;
which means a &#8220;reed.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig2">2</a>, &#8220;Q&#8221; we have a picture of a fish; the
meaning of the Assyrian ideogram derived from it are
a &#8220;fish,&#8221; to &#8220;peel&#8221; (from preparing a fish for eating),
the god Ea, on account of his sometimes being represented
in the form of a fish, and finally a &#8220;prince,&#8221; and
&#8220;great&#8221; from its association with Ea. Below (&#8220;R&#8221;) is
another fish, provided with what appears to be a dorsal
fin, hence the signification of the Assyrian sign is
&#8220;broad&#8221; or a &#8220;monster.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our next illustration (&#8220;I&#8221;) is concerned with water:
we have here the wavy lines for water which is similarly
represented in both Egyptian and Chinese hieroglyphics.
Below (&#8220;J&#8221;) we have a representation of the
little irrigation ditches by which gardens are watered:
hence the cuneiform ideogram derives the meaning of
&#8220;field&#8221; and stands for two distinct Assyrian words&#8212;&#8220;ginu&#8221;
and &#8220;iklu,&#8221; both of which mean &#8220;field.&#8221; It is
somewhat doubtful what the hieroglyph in &#8220;K&#8221; is intended
to represent: Hommel regarded it as a picture
of a leathern bottle which would not unnaturally suggest
the meaning &#8220;desert&#8221;; Barton, on the other hand,
with perhaps greater probability regards it as a rude
outline of the Euphrates valley, with its two rivers and
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 99</span>its &#8220;occasional sections of irrigated and so fertile land,&#8221;
indicated by the cross-lines, and he rightly says that
this would account for the meanings &#8220;plain&#8221; and
&#8220;lands,&#8221; and by an extension &#8220;desert,&#8221; &#8220;elevated
country,&#8221; and last of all &#8220;back.&#8221; In &#8220;L&#8221; we see the
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 100</span>picture of a house, which however hardly corresponds
with our conception of what a house should be: the
cuneiform sign derived from it is the ideogram for
&#8220;bitu&#8221; (the Hebrew &#8220;Beth&#8221; occurring in the proper
names Bethlehem, &#8220;house of bread,&#8221; Bethshemesh,
&#8220;house of the sun,&#8221; etc.), the ordinary Assyrian word
for &#8220;house.&#8221;</p>

pp. 241 ff.&#8212;<i>By permission</i>.</p></div>

<p>The next figure (&#8220;M&#8221;) shows us a covered and steaming
pot; hence the meanings of the later cuneiform sign
are to &#8220;burst forth,&#8221; &#8220;exult,&#8221; &#8220;rejoice.&#8221; &#8220;N&#8221; is somewhat
doubtful, but it probably represents a &#8220;priestly
garment,&#8221; inasmuch as the cuneiform sign derived from
it is the Assyrian ideogram for &#8220;&#353;angu&#8221; a &#8220;priest.&#8221;
&#8220;O&#8221; is apparently a rude picture of either a crown or
a ceremonial umbrella, as the emblem of greatness, the
picture of the Assyrian king attended by a slave whose
office it is to hold an umbrella over the head of his royal
master being, through its frequent occurrence on the bas-reliefs
which adorned the walls of the palaces, sufficiently
familiar. However that maybe, the cuneiform sign is the
ordinary ideogram for &#8220;rabu&#8221; (the root which occurs in
Rabshakeh, Rabsaris, etc.), which means &#8220;great&#8221;; we
have already seen this sign compounded with the picture
of a man, the two together meaning &#8220;king.&#8221; In &#8220;P&#8221;
we see a picture of a bowl in which two tinder-sticks
have been inserted with a view to their ignition by friction;
hence is derived the meaning of the cuneiform
sign developed from it,&#8212;&#8220;fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>As has been already indicated, clay was the material
mostly used by the Assyrian and Babylonian scribes for
the purposes of writing; but stone was also extensively
used from the earliest to the latest times. Stone obelisks,
colossal statues of bulls and lions, and last but far from
least the bas-reliefs which decorated the walls of the royal
palaces were generally covered with an inscription, the
wedges sometimes measuring as much as two inches.
In writing on sculpture the carved figures were completely
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 101</span>ignored, the inscription being chiselled regardlessly
through every detail of the carving. Stone was
however sometimes used solely and exclusively as the
material medium for perpetuating a legal agreement, or
immortalizing the work of some self-satisfied grandee,
and tablets of limestone or alabaster exist in large numbers,
good examples of which are those of Rîm-Sin and
Sin-Gamil, rulers of the ancient city of Larsa.</p>

<p>Boundary-stones or land-marks form another interesting
class of inscribed stone objects. The texts refer to
land-tenure and property conveyancing, while the upper
part of most of these boulder-shaped monuments is sculptured
in relief with mythological emblems. They belong
almost exclusively to the Kassite period. Sometimes
a plan of the field seems to have been chiselled on
the stone which marked its boundary. A good example
of such a boundary-stone is that of Nebuchadnezzar I,
which was discovered at Nippur and is published by
W. J. Hinke;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> a further point of interest about this
stone is that it is inscribed with a hymn to En-lil, the god
of Nippur.</p>

<p>But neither the Babylonians nor the Assyrians confined
themselves exclusively to the use of clay and calcareous
stone as the material whereon to write their inscriptions.
Sometimes the hardest volcanic rocks were
employed for the purpose, doubtless in consideration
of their durability and power of resisting the devastating
influences of time and climate. Thus in the course of
the German excavations at Babylon a plate of dolerite
measuring about a foot and a half square and bearing
an inscription of Adad-nirari the son of Ashur-dan was
discovered. So too Dungi and Bur-Sin, kings of Ur
(<i>circ.</i> 2350 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), have left us inscriptions chiselled on
hard diorite, the inscriptions themselves being of a votive
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 102</span>character, while a club-button made of the same material
and bearing an inscription of ten lines was found at
Babylon. The various statues and stelæ made of these
hard igneous stones and found both in Assyria and Babylonia,
though more frequently in the mother country,
practically always bear an inscription. A good example
of an Assyrian inscription on basalt is that found on the
basalt statue of Shalmaneser II (860-825 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), which
was brought to light in the course of the recent excavations
conducted by the Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft at
Ashur. Again the numerous stone gate-sockets discovered
in the ruins of early buildings in Babylonia are
nearly all inscribed with the name and titles of the person
who erected the building, and sometimes the original
inscription has been erased or obliterated to make room
for the inscription of a later ruler, who knowing full well
the difficulty of procuring stone in the low-lying country
of Babylonia, was not so short-sighted as to cast away
the gate-sockets of his vanquished predecessor, but on
the contrary utilized them for his own new building.
Thus for example the gate-socket of Lugal-kigub-nidudu,
an early king of Sumer, was subsequently used by
Shar-Gâni-sharri, king of Akkad, in the construction of
his temple at Nippur.</p>

<p>But sometimes stones of comparative rarity, such as
lapis lazuli, were employed as a material whereon to
engrave inscriptions: thus a tablet made of that material
and dedicated by Lugal-tarsi, an early king of
Kish, to the god Anu and the goddess Ninni, is preserved
in the British Museum, and in the course of
the recent excavations at Babylon two bars of lapis
lazuli with reliefs and both bearing cuneiform inscriptions
were discovered. One of these showed the picture
of a god standing up, surmounted with a feather
crown, and holding the symbol of lightning in each
hand, while his dress is decorated with three shields,
and a cuneiform inscription of five lines is further added;
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 103</span>on the other, a god in similar posture and dress but
holding a staff and ring on his breast and grasping the
tail of a double-horned dragon in his right hand is portrayed:
the god&#8217;s girdle is decorated with figures, while
on one of the three shields adorning the raiment, horses
are depicted, and there is an accompanying inscription
of eight lines.</p>

<p>Metal in like manner was not exempt from being
drawn into the service, the metals mostly employed
being bronze and copper. Thus the female statuettes
from Tellô all bear an inscription, Elamite or Babylonian
as the case may be, the general purport of which
is that the statuette is dedicated with a view to the preservation
of the life of the donor: so too the colossal
copper lance-head discovered on the same site bears a
royal inscription, while the famous bronze gate-sheaths
from Balâwât belonging to the time of Shalmaneser II,
are perhaps the most familiar instance of cuneiform inscriptions
engraved on bronze. Many bronze tablets
of the Assyrian period have been found, and the well-known
bronze doorstep of Nebuchadnezzar II provides
us with another excellent example of an inscription engraved
on metal. Moreover the more precious metals
such as silver and gold were occasionally inscribed.
Inscriptions on gold are very rare, but by no means
unknown. M. de Sarzec for example found a plate of
gold bearing a cuneiform inscription at Tellô, and a
strip of gold bearing the name of the illustrious Narâm-Sin
of Agade was brought to light in the course of the
American excavations at Bismâya.</p>

<p>But the inscribed clay tablets, countless in number
and infinitely various in size, shape and contents, far outweigh
in importance all other kinds of cuneiform inscriptions
in existence. A detailed treatment of the latter
would far exceed the necessary limits of this little volume,
but a few words may be said regarding the main classes
of tablets discovered. Their size and shape are sometimes
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 104</span>indicative of the period to which they belong,
sometimes of the subject-matter with which they deal. A
very early type is represented by those found below the
level of Ur-Ninâ&#8217;s building at Tellô; the tablets in question
which have not been baked in an oven, and are round
in form, deal with the sale and purchase of land. Similar
round tablets were found by the German excavators at
Fâra, which were however baked and not sun-dried.
The same rounded baked clay tablets were evidently in
vogue at the time of Bur-Sin, for several have been
brought to light which are dated in his reign, and contain
details regarding certain landed property. But the
commonest type of clay tablet is that characterized by
its rectangular shape, sometimes square, but more frequently
oblong, and varying greatly in size. The tablets
in the Kouyunjik collection, which represents the largest,
and in one sense the only Assyrian library as yet discovered,
vary from one to fifteen inches in length when complete,
many of them being made from the very finest clay.
The writing is sometimes exceedingly minute, though
marvellously clear and sharp, and is more or less stereotyped
in character. Astrology, astronomy, history, mythology,
magic, medicine, mathematics, prayers, hymns,
lists of gods, omens, lexicography and grammar are all
well represented in this famous library. Many of the
texts are copies of older Babylonian literature made by
Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s scribes, and stored away in the royal
archives. Some of the texts are bilingual, the top line
containing the Sumerian ideographic version, and the
lower line giving the Assyrian translation, and these
bilingual inscriptions together with the syllabaries have
enabled scholars to unravel and elucidate at all events
to some extent the old Sumerian language.</p>

<p>By the year 1873 all scholars were agreed that the
cuneiform script was not invented by the Semitic
Babylonians, but by a people who spoke an agglutinative
as opposed to an inflexional language, a language
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 105</span>which was therefore, at least in this respect, akin to
the Tartar languages. In the following year however
Joseph Halévy, the famous French Semitist,
started a theory which denied the existence of a Sumerian
language altogether, and explained the ideographic
texts in the bilingual inscriptions already alluded
to, as a secret writing intelligible only to the priests;
but primâ facie the theory lacked probability and even
plausibility. Halévy, it is true, propounded his theory
at a time when the study of Sumerian was in its infancy,
though it can hardly be said to have grown
out of its childhood even at the present day, but this
notwithstanding, it would be indeed singular if the
priests took the precaution to enshrine their secret lore
in cryptic language, and then frustrated themselves by
subscribing an Assyrian translation. Moreover many of
the Sumerian inscriptions treat of such very ordinary
matters, that it is extremely difficult to see how it could
have been necessary to employ a cryptic language to
conceal them. A more ready explanation is to be found
in the theory accepted by the majority of scholars
to-day,&#8212;that the Sumerian language existed side by
side with Semitic Babylonian, and was used much as
Latin is to-day.</p>

<p>One class of tablet especially easily distinguishable by
its shape and size is that comprising legal contracts for
the exchange of land, cattle and property of every description.
They are small in size, oblong in shape, both
sides being slightly concave, and the whole not unlike
a small narrow pillow in general appearance. Many of
these contract tablets were enclosed in clay envelopes to
ensure their preservation. When a contract was effected
by the Babylonians, the contracting parties had recourse
to a legal or priestly official, and the terms of the agreement
were set forth on a clay tablet which was deposited
either in the temple or the record chamber: it was
furthermore protected by a clay envelope upon which
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 106</span>the terms inscribed on the contract tablet were copied
in duplicate; thus every precaution was taken to secure
the preservation of the original document. Sometimes
the text on the envelope varies somewhat from that contained
in the document itself, and in such cases the
envelopes therefore have more than a purely archaic
interest, and are of actual linguistic value. One or two
copies were made of the contract and were kept by
either or both of the contracting parties. The deed was
subscribed by the witnesses, one of whom was the scribe
who drew up the document and sealed it. The seal was
generally affixed by rolling a small cylinder seal over the
tablet while still moist, though sometimes a three-sided
clay cone received the impress of the seal, and this cone
was attached to the tablet by means of a reed inserted in
the apex of the cone, the other end of the reed being
joined to the tablet by a piece of moist clay. Many of
these contract &#8220;case&#8221; tablets belong to the times of
Khammurabi, the most celebrated king of the First
Dynasty of Babylon (<i>circ.</i> 1900 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). Some of the envelopes
of these tablets bear the impression of a cylinder-seal,
a good example of which is found on a tablet
recording the sale of a piece of land by Sin-eribam and
his brother to Sin-ikisham (Brit. Mus. No. 92649).
The clay of this class of tablet is generally somewhat
dark in colour, and the characters are often difficult to
read.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Inscriptions on clay illustrating the sizes and shapes of the
tablets etc. used by the Babylonians and Assyrians</span></p></div>

<p>The later, or Neo-Babylonian legal and commercial
documents show greater variation in size and shape than
those belonging to the time of the First Dynasty of
Babylon. They are generally oblong, but on the smaller
tablets the text is generally written in such a manner that
each line extends over the length of the tablet instead
of over its breadth. The larger legal documents of this
period are sometimes inscribed on tablets of quite exceptional
thickness, their general size and shape being
not unlike that of an old Latin prayer-book.</p>

<p><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 107</span></p>

<p>But contracts were not the only kind of inscription
protected by a clay envelope or &#8220;case&#8221;; letters and
despatches sometimes shared the same consideration.
Like contracts, letters were inscribed on small oblong
tablets, such as might be easily transmitted through the
Babylonian and Assyrian post, that is to say carried by
the messenger whose duty it was to convey the letter to
its destination. As might be expected, the envelope in
this case bore the name of the person to whom the letter
was addressed, and occasionally also that of the sender,
just as the envelopes of letters are sometimes initialled
to-day. Many of these letters are of a royal character,
and emanate from kings and princes. Quite a number
of letters and despatches from the early kings of
Babylon to their officials and governors have come
down to us. They treat of divers subjects: in one
Khammurabi writes to Sin-Idinnam commanding him
to send forty-seven shepherds to Babylon in order that
they may give an account to the king of the flocks
under their care (Brit. Mus. No. 23122). In another
letter the king writes to the same prince with instructions
to arrest three officials and despatch them to Babylon,
while in yet another Khammurabi writes to Sin-Idinnam
with orders to restore a certain baker to his
former position. Some of Sin-Idinnam&#8217;s official correspondence
has also been preserved. In one communication
he directs a legal officer to summon a certain man
to appear in court (Brit. Mus. No. 12868). Sin-Idinnam&#8217;s
duties were clearly very varied and must have
been sufficiently arduous. In one of these despatches
Khammurabi orders Sin-Idinnam to cut down some
&#8220;Abba&#8221; trees required by smelters of metal (Brit. Mus.
No. 26234). In another he commands the same personage
to see to the mustering of crews for transport-barges
(Brit. Mus. No. 27288). Others contain instructions
to attend to the repair of the banks of the
Euphrates at various points. But his duties were not
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 108</span>exclusively civil; judicial affairs fell to his charge also;
thus it is that to him the king writes regarding a dispute
between a landlord and his tenant concerning the
payment of rent for land, while he is perpetually receiving
orders to arrest delinquent officials and other
misconducted persons. In one letter (Brit. Mus. No.
12827) Khammurabi directs Sin-Idinnam to postpone
the date of a certain trial, owing to the presence of the
plaintiff, one Ili-Ippalzam, in the city of Ur at a certain
festival.</p>

<p>Elsewhere (Brit. Mus. No. 12841) Khammurabi issues
a report to the same overburdened official to the
effect that certain persons have cancelled a deed of mortgage,
and commands the instant presence of Enubi-Marduk,
who received their lands on mortgage, in
Babylon. Many of the letters of these early kings of
Babylon embody the royal wishes regarding the date
of sheep-shearing, or the reaping of corn, as well as
instructions concerning the irrigation canals.</p>

<p>In one letter, Samsu-iluna (Brit. Mus. No. 27269)
instructs Sin-Idinnam and the judges of Sippar to prohibit
certain fishermen from fishing in forbidden waters;
at other times the same judges are directed to send a
particular case for trial in the capital (cf. Brit. Mus. No.
27266). Another collection of letters written in cuneiform
and on clay tablets are the famous Tell el-Amarna
Letters,&#8212;generally of somewhat larger size and less
distinctly oblong than the ordinary Babylonian despatches.
The majority of them are rectangular, though a
few are oval. Some are convex on both sides, some are
flat on both sides, while others are plano-convex or
pillow-shaped. These tablets were discovered at Tell
el-Amarna in Egypt; they represent nearly all that remains
of the official and diplomatic correspondence which
passed between the Pharaohs Amenhetep III and Amenhetep
IV of the Eighteenth Dynasty (i.e. they belong
to the fourteenth or fifteenth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), and their
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 109</span>various officials and vassals in Palestine. Some of the
tablets found at Tell el-Amarna are inscribed with letters
from the King of Babylon, from the King of Mitani,
from the King of Alashiya, and other royal potentates,
but as they are mostly of Palestinian and Egyptian interest,
a detailed consideration of them would be out of
place in this volume.</p>

<p>Among the larger rectangular clay tablets in existence
are those containing syllabaries. Owing to the
deterioration and simplification which the cuneiform
characters underwent in the course of ages, the Assyrian
scribes found it necessary to make lists of the early
Babylonian characters adding what they believed to be
the later Assyrian equivalents. Most of these syllabaries
consist of three columns; in the middle column
the Assyrian sign to be explained is given, on the left
the Sumerian value of the same, and in the right-hand
column either the Assyrian name for the sign, or else
the Assyrian meaning, and occasionally both. These
syllabaries are obviously of immense importance in the
reconstruction of the old Sumerian language.</p>

<p>Other tablets of abnormally large size are those dealing
with astrology, magic and medicine: the two latter
subjects are inextricably confused owing to the fact that
they went hand in hand with each other; the medicine
was prescribed and administered, but the medicine alone
was by no means sufficient to cure the patient, that could
only be effected by the potent spell of the magician.</p>

<p>But the largest clay tablets emanate from Babylonia
and contain lists of accounts mostly concerning grain,
cattle, asses, lambs, sheep. Some of these tablets are perfectly
square, and measure as much as a foot each way,
while nearly all of them are more square than oblong:
the clay of which they are made is of fine quality, and
the Babylonian characters with which they are inscribed
are singularly clear. Most of them may be assigned to
the second half of the third millennium <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and many
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 110</span>of them are specifically dated in the reign of Dungi, king
of Ur about 2400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> But as already mentioned, tablets
were not always rectangular; sometimes they assumed
a circular form. Tablets of this kind are usually inscribed
in the Sumerian language, and contain lists of
landed estates and fields, with information regarding
their size, their capacity for producing crops and other
details. Many of these circular tablets are dated, the
year deriving its name after some noteworthy event, as
was the regular mode of dating in the early days of Babylonian
civilization. Thus many of these lists are dated
&#8220;in the year after that in which the land of Khukhnuri
was laid waste,&#8221; and were drawn up in the reign of Bur-Sin
and other kings of Ur, i.e. during the second half of
the third millennium <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The clay of which these tablets are made is of the
finest, while the writing is exceedingly clear; they vary
from about two to six inches in diameter, and are oval on
one side and more or less flat on the other.</p>

<p>Other large rectangular tablets are inscribed with lists
of the principal events in different kings&#8217; reigns and are
obviously of immense importance for the reconstruction
of Babylonian and Assyrian history. One of the tablets
belonging to this class (Brit. Mus. No. 92702) gives
us a list of the chief events, after which the various
years of Sumu-abu, Sumu-la-ilu, Zabum, Apil-Sin, Sin-muballit,
Khammurabi and Samsu-iluna, kings of the
first dynasty of Babylon (about the end of the third and
beginning of the second millennium <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) were named.
Another of the same class (Brit. Mus. No. 92502) gives
us a list of the leading events which took place in Babylonia
and Assyria from the third year of Nabonassar,
king of Babylon 744 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and the first year of Shamash-shum-ukîn,
the contemporary of Ashur-bani-pal (668
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). One of the most interesting events here alluded
to is the assassination of Sennacherib by his son on the
20th day of the month Tebet, and in the 23rd year of
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 111</span>his reign. Among other historical documents of primary
importance, a tablet generally known as &#8220;the Synchronous
History&#8221; must be placed in the first rank.
This document is an agreement drawn up about the time
of Ashur-bani-pal, and it had as its object the settlement
of boundary-disputes between Babylonia and Assyria,
while its historical value lies largely in the short notices
of the various conflicts and alliances between the two
countries from about 1600-800 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> One other large
rectangular tablet (K. 3751) of exceptional interest
alike to the historian and the Biblical student, is the
document in which Tiglath-Pileser III, king of Assyria
745-727 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, gives us an account of his building operations
and conquests, and mentions &#8220;Ahaz, King of
Judah&#8221; as one of his tributary princes. This tablet
must have been very large when complete, for what remains
of it measures nine inches by seven and a half.
The largest tablet in the Kouyunjik collection is not
however historical in character, but contains a list of
the names and titles of various gods, and in its present
fragmentary state measures fifteen inches in length.</p>

<p>Other cuneiform inscriptions were written on pieces
of clay shaped like cones. Most of these terra-cotta
cones date from the time of the dynasty of Ur, i.e. the
latter half of the third millennium <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> Two good examples
of this kind of cuneiform inscription bear the
name of Sin-gashid, king of Erech, and record the dedication
of a temple to the god Lugal-banda and the goddess
Ninsun, and give the price of wool, grain, oil and
copper during the reign of Sin-gashid (Brit. Mus. 91,
150). Another baked clay cone is inscribed with the
name of Sin-idinnam, king of Larsa about 2300 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>,
and likewise records the dedication of a temple&#8212;in this
case that of the Sun-god, Larsa being one of the principal
centres of the worship of the Sun-god. But the conquering
Elamites, who imitated their subjugated enemies,
the Babylonians, in so many ways, also adopted the
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 112</span>practice of writing cuneiform inscriptions on clay cones;
for an example of an Elamite cone we may compare
Brit. Mus. 91, 149, which bears the name of Kudur-Mabug.
But the habit of writing inscriptions on clay
cones did not cease at this period, at least not permanently,
for a similar cone exists bearing the name of the
Neo-Babylonian king Nabopolassar (625-604 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), and
like the older cones recording the dedication of a temple,
this time the temple of Marduk at Babylon. (Brit.
Mus. No. 91,090.)</p>

<p>But Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions on clay were
not always in the form of rectangular or circular tablets;
frequently they assumed the form of large hexagonal,
octagonal, or decagonal prisms, or in the case of Babylonia
of barrel-shaped cylinders. It was customary to
place these large clay memorials in the four corners of
the foundation of a building in Babylonia and Assyria,
a good example of which practice was found at Muḳeyyer
(Ur): the cylinders from Ur had been deposited at
the four angles of the foundation of the temple of Sin,
the Moon-god, by Nabonidus, and they record the rebuilding
of the temple by Nabonidus (555-538 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) on
the site of the ancient temple erected by Ur-Engur and
his son Dungi, about 2400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> The text finds a fitting
conclusion in a prayer to the god whose fane he is restoring,
on behalf of his eldest son Bal-shar-uṣur, the
Biblical Belshazzar. Three octagonal prisms of baked
clay give us an account of the campaigns and building
operations of Tiglath-Pileser I, king of Assyria about
1100 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> (Brit. Mus. 91033-91035). Another prism is
inscribed with an account of the expeditions of Sargon,
king of Assyria 721-705 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> (Brit. Mus. No. 22505),
while the fragments of an octagonal prism of the same
king, and also preserved in the British Museum, (K. 1668,
etc.) are of peculiar interest in that they give Sargon&#8217;s
own account of his campaign against the Philistine city
of Ashdod, which is referred to in Isaiah <span class="smcap">XX. I.</span> Judah is
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 113</span>mentioned as one of the allies of Ashdod, but the Assyrians
were ultimately successful in reducing the rebellious
city. Sargon&#8217;s successor, Sennacherib (705-681 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>),
similarly caused his military achievements to be recorded
on large clay prisms, and the most interesting document
of his reign is preserved on the six sides of a hexagonal
prism now in the British Museum (91032). It records
the defeat of Merodach-Baladan, king of Babylon, and
the subjugation of various other peoples, but the particular
interest attaching to this cylinder lies in the allusions
to the Palestinian campaign of 2 Kings xviii.
Sennacherib states that he severely punished the rebellious
people of Ekron and restored the banished Padî to
his throne; he then proceeded to attack Hezekiah in
Jerusalem &#8220;his royal city&#8221;; he laid siege to Jerusalem,
and shut Hezekiah up like a bird in a cage, but in spite
of this demonstration, he was clearly unable to open the
cage and seize the bird. However, Hezekiah seems to
have been duly impressed, and he hastened to buy off
Sennacherib with gifts and tribute&#8212;&#8220;thirty talents of
gold, eight hundred talents of silver, precious stones, eye
paint ... ivory couches and thrones, hides and tusks,
precious woods and divers objects,&#8221; together with his
daughters, his women-folk and male and female
musicians&#8212;apparently being the price.</p>

<p>Another interesting octagonal prism of this same king
has been recently acquired by the British Museum (No.
103,000). It contains information regarding two campaigns
not recorded elsewhere. The first of these, which
took place in 698 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, was undertaken to suppress a revolt
in Cilicia; the campaign was completely successful
and the Assyrian power was entirely restored in those
regions. It is interesting to note that the city of Tarsus
was one of those which Sennacherib sacked on this occasion.
The second campaign took place three years
later in 695 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and resulted in the siege and capture of
a certain city called Til-Garimum in the land of Tubal,
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 114</span>which lay to the north-east of Cilicia. We are also furnished
with an account of the rebuilding and fortification
of Nineveh by Sennacherib, which contains valuable
information regarding the inner and outer wall of the
city, and the positions and names of the fifteen gates. It
is dated in the eponymy<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> of Ilu-Ittia, the Assyrian
governor of Damascus. This cylinder was apparently
buried as a foundation memorial in the structure of one
of the city gates referred to in the text.</p>

<p>Esarhaddon, Sennacherib&#8217;s son and successor, has likewise
left us a number of hexagonal prisms of historic
importance. One of the principal events narrated on
Esarhaddon&#8217;s cylinders is the siege and capture of Sidon
and the subjugation of the surrounding country. Ashur-bani-pal,
Esarhaddon&#8217;s famous son and successor, has
left us a number of cylinders and prisms, but by far the
most important is that upon which an account of the
principal events of the early part of his reign is inscribed
(Brit. Mus., No. 91,026). We have here a record of his
first and second Egyptian campaigns, of the defeat he
inflicted upon Tirhakah, the Ethiopian king of Egypt,
and the sack of Thebes, the capital of the country. The
capture of Tyre is also narrated and the campaign against
Te-Umman, king of Elam, whom Ashur-bani-pal slew
and whose severed head is seen hanging from a tree in
the bas-relief in which Ashur-bani-pal and his wife are
reclining at meat in their garden. There is also an account
of the siege and capture of Babylon, whose king
Shamash-shum-ukîn had thrown off the suzerainty of
Assyria; the conquest of Arabia is recorded as well as
the final triumph of the Assyrian arms over Elam, and
the text concludes with an account of Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s
building operations.</p>

<p><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 115</span></p>

<p>We have already alluded to a clay cylinder belonging
to the Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus, while another
cylinder of the same king, which has been discussed
elsewhere (cf. p. <a href="#Page_7">7</a>), is equally notable, as a complete
system of chronology has been based upon its contents.
Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon 604-561 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and
belonging to the same dynasty has likewise left us a number
of barrel-shaped cylinders, the inscriptions upon
which are chiefly concerned with a recital of his building
achievements, while to the cylinder of Cyrus the Persian
conqueror of Babylonia (538 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) reference has been
made elsewhere (cf. p. <a href="#Page_74">74</a>). But the practice of writing
cuneiform inscriptions on baked clay cylinders did not
even come to an end with the Persian kings of Babylonia,
for we have a cylinder (Brit. Mus. 36277) bearing
an inscription in archaic Babylonian characters, of Antiochus
Soter, king of Babylonia about 280 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>; it records
the restoration of the temples E-Sagil, and E-zida in
Babylon and Borsippa in the year 270 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and concludes
with a prayer to the god Nebo on behalf of Antiochus,
his son Seleucus and his wife.</p>

<p>But besides rectangular, round, barrel-shaped, cylindrical
and cone-shaped clay inscriptions, yet other varieties
exist. Among these a four-sided block of clay forming
an elongated kind of cube, the height of which is
9-1/2 inches and the breadth of each of its four sides 3-3/4
inches (Brit. Mus. No. 92611), deserves a mention;
its date is about 2100 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and it is inscribed with lists
of the names of fish, birds, plants, stones and garments.</p>

<p>Another unique object is a clay model of an ox-hoof
(Brit. Mus. No. R. 620), inscribed with forecasts. A
somewhat similar object is found in a clay model of a
sheep&#8217;s liver, also preserved in the British Museum (No.
92,668); the inscription which it bears is magical in character,
and the object was probably used for divination
purposes. Other tablets, though not being moulded in
the form of a sheep&#8217;s liver, bear the incised outlines of
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 116</span>different parts of the liver. Hepatoscopy, or the practice
of deriving omens from the shape, size, or condition of
the liver, was one of the most popular forms of magic
among the Babylonians and Assyrians.</p>

<p>Plans of cities seem to have sometimes been drawn on
clay tablets, a good example of which is afforded by a tablet
discovered at Nippur, and incised with a plan of that
city, a plan which in spite of its antiquity seems to have
helped the work of the excavators in no small degree.
Another example is the British Museum fragment (No.
35385), on which a plan of part of the city of Babylon is
still to be seen. Sometimes the plan was merely that of
an estate (cf. Brit. Mus. No. 31483), but in one instance
at all events, the world itself is the subject (Brit. Mus.
No. 92687), the most interesting feature of which from
the geographical point of view is the world-encircling
ocean&#8212;the Babylonians believing the earth to be surrounded
by and apparently supported on water: the
earth itself was supposed to resemble an inverted saucer
in shape, while the heavens bore the same shape, the only
difference being that they were obviously more extensive,
and the lower edges rested on the earth itself, while
the edge of the earth rested upon the ocean.</p>

<p>Sometimes amulets were made of clay, a good example
of which is Brit. Mus. No. 85-4-8, 1; it is shaped like a
cylinder-seal, and is inscribed with an incantation for
Shamash-Killâni.</p>

<p>Other inscribed clay objects are those known as astrolabæ
or instruments for making astrological calculations.</p>

<p>Labels again were made of clay: two small clay labels
(Brit. Mus. K. 1400, K. 1539) give us the titles of two
series of astrological and omen tablets; while another
(K. 3787) gives us the name of Khipa, a female slave; it
is dated in the 11th year of Marduk-aplu-iddina, i.e. <i>circ.</i>
710 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> There are miscellaneous clay objects which do
not properly come under the heading of terra-cotta
figures or clay bas-reliefs, and therefore may be mentioned
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 117</span>here. Sometimes clay squeezes or impressions
were made of early inscriptions; an excellent example of
such squeezes was acquired some years ago by the University
of Pennsylvania (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig3">3</a>);<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> it is a squeeze made
by a Neo-Babylonian scribe of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> of
an inscription belonging to Shar-Gâni-sharri, king of
Akkad. The characters of course are raised in relief and
read backwards. Allusion is elsewhere made to the clay
brick-stamps with which Babylonian kings were in the
habit of inscribing their building bricks: an interesting
specimen of a clay brick-stamp is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>. It is a
fragment of a stamp belonging to Narâm-Sin, the son of
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 118</span>Shar-Gâni-sharri. The characters here are of course in relief
and reversed as in the case of a seal. Another clay object
of exceptional interest is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig5">5</a>; it is a clay
covering made by order of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon
625-604 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, for the preservation of the stone tablet
of his predecessor Nabû-aplu-iddina (<i>circ.</i> 870 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). It
was presumably during the course of his work at the
restoration of the temple of the Sun-god at Sippar that
he alighted upon this early tablet. The clay cover bears
an inscription of Nabopolassar on the reverse side and
records the various offerings he deposited at the shrine
of the Sun-god. The cover itself was found in a baked
clay box, also preserved in the British Museum, and probably
belonging to the same reign. Clay was further
employed by the sculptor for tentative sketches, and by
the stone-inscriber for rough drafts. Thus the sculptor
to whom we are indebted for the portrayal of Ashur-bani-pal,
king of Assyria, spearing a lion, sketched out his picture
in clay preparatory to chiselling it on slabs of stone,
and his original sketch is still extant (cf. Brit. Mus.
93011), while we can still see two rough drafts on clay of
epigraphs inscribed on Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s bas-reliefs (cf.
Brit. Mus. Sm. 1350 and K. 4453 + K. 4515).</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V&#8212;ARCHITECTURE</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE architecture of a country is determined very
largely by the materials with which nature has
endowed that country; it is also influenced by the
configuration of the country itself as well as by the
climate whose effects it is the builder&#8217;s object to either
regulate or counteract. The physical characteristics of
the Mesopotamian Valley as also the climatic conditions
which prevail there have already been under consideration,
but it will not perhaps be unfitting to devote a few
pages to a review of the materials which were used for
building operations, before we proceed to discuss the
ruins of the buildings themselves.</p>

<p>It has been already stated, that practically no stone
at all is to be found in the low-lying and marshy country
of Babylonia, hence it never assumed an important place
in Babylonian architecture; any stone required, had to
be quarried far away in the mountains and transported
at great labour, in consequence of which it was only
employed for exceptional purposes and in cases where
the desire for permanent durability rendered it necessary.
Accordingly the stone used was generally diorite,
basalt, or some other hard stone of volcanic origin, contrasting
strikingly with the softer stone utilized so
freely by the Assyrians. Assyria on the other hand
was more fortunate in this respect and afforded a
very fair supply of limestone and alabaster which
were used extensively by her sculptors and builders,
though the clay so easily procurable all over the valley
was the one indispensable element in the erection
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 120</span>of temples, palaces, or houses in both countries.
The supply of wood again was extremely scanty not
only in Babylonia but also in Assyria, and any wood
used for columns, lintels or thresholds was generally
brought from Lebanon, Amanus, or some other distant
place.</p>

<p>We thus see that the art of brick-building was almost
forced upon the dwellers of Mesopotamia from the very
necessity of the case.</p>

<p>The clay used for the purpose was by no means
uniform either as regards its colour, or as regards its
quality. Sometimes it is of a light yellow colour, sometimes
it is almost black, while the clay from which other
bricks are made is of a reddish hue. Those made of
light yellow clay are the best from the point of view of
durability. The bricks further vary both in size and
shape according to the period to which they belong, so
that it is often possible to provisionally assign a date to
a building or the remains of a building by an examination
of the style of brick employed. The type of brick
characteristic of the early periods of Sumerian history
is that known as the plano-convex<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> type; thus the kiln-burnt
bricks of which the storehouse of Ur-Ninâ, the
first king of Lagash, was composed, are oblong and
plano-convex, while each of them also bears the impression
of a thumb-mark on the convex side.</p>

<p>But a yet earlier form of brick<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> was found in the
building underneath Ur-Ninâ&#8217;s storehouse: the bricks
of which this building was composed were indeed
plano-convex like those of Ur-Ninâ, but they were
smaller, had no thumb- or finger-marks and were also
unfortunately uninscribed.</p>

<p>At Mu&#7731;eyyer (Ur) Taylor came across a pavement
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 121</span>made of plano-convex bricks, the antiquity of which
was attested alike by the appearance of this type of
brick and also by the depth below the surface at which
the platform was found. This excavator discovered
similar bricks at Abû Shahrein (Eridu), a further
corroboration of the traditional antiquity of Ea&#8217;s once
famous city. The excavations at other early sites have
also yielded the same results; at Fâra (Shuruppak)
the traditional scene of the Deluge, as well as at
Yôkha, Bismâya, and in the pre-Sargonic strata at
Nippur, the same style of bricks has been found.</p>

<p>But with the expansion of the Semites, culminating
in the establishment of the empire of Shar-Gâni-sharri
and his son Narâm-Sin, the comparatively small, oblong
and plano-convex brick fell into disuse, and gave way to
a large square brick. Immediately beneath the crude-brick
platform of Ur-Engur (<i>circ.</i> 2400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) at Nippur,
part of the earlier work of Narâm-Sin and Shar-Gâni-sharri
was uncovered, the bricks used being no
longer plano-convex and oblong, but flat and square,
and measuring 20 x 20 x 3-1/2 inches; they are made of
clay mixed with straw, and are at the same time well-dried
and very hard; this type of brick was employed
in all the buildings of these two kings.</p>

<p>The next period in the history of Babylonian brick-making
is that belonging to the times of the second
dynasty of Lagash and the first dynasty of Ur (i.e. <i>circ.</i>
2450 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). The type of brick characteristic of this age
resembles that of the preceding in regard to shape but
not in regard to size. The bricks of Ur-Engur, king
of Ur, and of Gudea, the most renowned ruler of the
second dynasty of Lagash (<i>circ.</i> 2450 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) are square
like those of their Semitic predecessors, Shar-Gâni-sharri
and Narâm-Sin, but very much smaller, measuring
a little over 12 x 12 inches, and this small square brick
remained in use, with occasional slight variations, till the
close of Mesopotamian history. The transition from
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 122</span>the large brick used by the kings of Agade to the small
brick in question was doubtless effected only gradually,
for the bricks of Ur-bau, ruler of Lagash some time before
Gudea, are larger than those of the latter king, but
after the time of Gudea and Ur-Engur, the shape and
size of the bricks became more or less stereotyped. The
bricks of Ur-Engur himself vary somewhat from those
of Gudea, thus the solid mass underlying the temple-tower
at Nippur, which was constructed by Ur-Engur,
is composed of bricks measuring only 9 × 6 × 3 inches, the
arms of the causeway on the other hand are built of larger
bricks measuring 14 × 14 × 6 inches. Kiln-burnt bricks
were always used for the important parts of the building
in Babylonia, the crude sun-dried bricks which as a rule
formed the core of the terraced platforms, being revetted
with a wall of burnt brick, or sometimes, in the case of
Assyria with a supporting wall of stone. The reason of
course for this lay in the inability of sun-dried bricks
to resist damp, and their corresponding tendency to disintegrate.
The bricks were as a rule carried on to the
ground as soon as they were fairly dry and firm, and
were laid while still soft.</p>

<p>Generally speaking the bricks bear the name of the
king who caused the structure to be made, thus the
majority of the bricks of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon
(604-561 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) are inscribed:&#8212;&#8220;Nebuchadnezzar,
King of Babylon, restorer of the pyramid and tower,
eldest son of Nabopolassar, King of Babylon, am I.&#8221;
It is interesting to note that though the tiles on the western
side of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s palace at Babylon bear the
ordinary stamp of that king, those on the eastern side are
stamped with a lion and an Aramaic inscription. Koldewey
indeed says that there is no doubt that this part
of the building was also erected by Nebuchadnezzar, as
wall-tiles bearing the regular palace-inscription of the
king have been found there. Prof. Euting however,
from the forms of the Aramaic characters, would assign
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 123</span>these Aramaic-inscribed bricks to the middle of the
seventh century, i.e. about 650 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> None of the
bricks found on the Kasr mound bear the stamp of
any Assyrian kings, the latter apparently only having
left their marks on the floor-bricks of E-sagila, the
temple of Marduk. The characters were generally impressed
with a stamp, though on both Assyrian and
Babylonian bricks the inscription was sometimes engraved
by hand. The stamps used were made of terra-cotta;
a well-preserved specimen of a terra-cotta brick-stamp
is that of Narâm-Sin referred to above (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>),
while a terra-cotta brick-stamp of Shar-Gâni-sharri, the
father of Narâm-Sin, was discovered at Nippur, and one
of the minor results of the expedition to Bismâya, directed
by Harper, was the discovery of a number of clay
brick-stamps. Many Assyrian and Babylonian bricks
are glazed or enamelled and coloured in the most ornate
fashion, and with the most striking pictures and designs,
but an examination of these will naturally find its place
in the chapter devoted to &#8220;Painting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sometimes the architects of Babylonia contrived to
adapt the clay employed in their building operations
to decorative devices. Such was the case at Warka
(Erech) where Loftus discovered a wall some thirty feet
long, composed entirely of clay cones fixed in a cement
made of mud and straw, and laid horizontally with their
bases outwards. Some of these cones had been coloured
red or black and were arranged to form various geometrical
designs. They were sometimes inscribed, sometimes
not. But clay cones were apparently not the only
kind of cone used for architectural decoration, for in the
course of his excavations at Abû Shahrein, Taylor<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> discovered
cones of limestone and marble, some of which
had a &#8220;rim round the edge filled with copper&#8221;; these
cones vary from four to ten inches in length, their diameter
measuring from one to three inches.</p>

<p><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 124</span></p>

<h3>MORTAR</h3>

<p>The layers and courses of clay bricks of which the
buildings in Mesopotamia were for the most part composed,
were cemented together by mud in the earliest
times; this clay-mud is generally distinguishable from
the bricks which it unites by the difference of its colour.
Mud-mortar has been found on some of the earliest
sites and in some of the most ancient buildings, while
in Assyria it appears to have been the regular form of
cement used at all times. In the city of Babylon, strange
to say, clay mortar appears to have been used instead
of lime or asphalt in the late buildings of Sassanidian
times. This mud-mortar consisted of clay mixed with
water and perhaps a little straw, as was the case in the
cone-wall at Warka,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> while sometimes reeds embedded
in clay were laid between the bricks, as was the case at
both Warka and Hammam, but at an extremely remote
period the Babylonian architect began to avail
himself of the rich supply of bitumen gratuitously
yielded by the soil of his native land, for the purpose in
question.</p>

<p>The most famous bituminous springs in Mesopotamia
were those at &#7716;it on the Euphrates. Their fame had
reached Egypt as early as the time of the eighteenth dynasty,
for Thothmes III brought bitumen thence to
Egypt. Herodotus a millennium later&#8212;about 450<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>&#8212;alludes
to &#7716;it as famous for her bitumen, and subsequent
writers make similar mention of the springs
there. A good example of the early use of bitumen in
Babylonia was found at Abû Shahrein, the site of ancient
Eridu, where a very early building was excavated by
Taylor, the antiquity of which was proved by the pre-Sargonic
plano-convex bricks used in its construction,
and these bricks were all laid in bitumen; the same was
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 125</span>found to be the case in a building composed of finger-marked
bricks at Ur (Mu&#7731;eyyer), all of which were embedded
in bitumen.</p>

<p>The platform upon which Ur-Ninâ&#8217;s storehouse at
Tellô was erected consisted of three layers of plano-convex
and finger-marked bricks, all set in bitumen,
while in the building underneath that of Ur-Ninâ,
bitumen was also freely used.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>In like manner at Nippur, the finger-marked bricks
of which the city-gate was constructed were laid in
bitumen, though the bricks composing the early arch
found on this site were set in mud, probably an indication
that at the time when the arch was built bitumen
was not used; around the base of Ur-Engur&#8217;s ziggurat
on the other hand there was a coating of bitumen,
while the crude brick altar found by Haynes in the
lowest stratum at Nippur had a rim of bitumen; but in
later times it was supplemented by the more tenacious
lime-mortar, though only partially was this the case,
for even as late as Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s time (604-561
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) its practical utility as a preventive against the destructive
forces of rain were still recognized, the burnt
brick retaining walls of his palace at Babylon being
actually laid in bitumen. In like manner the bricks
composing the old fortification wall, are rendered adhesive
by means of a lavish prodigality of asphalt, so
adhesive in fact, that it is often very difficult to separate
them. Fortunately the side bearing the stamped inscription
has its face downwards and therefore is not
in immediate contact with the asphalt from which it is
separated by the layer of reeds and clay already alluded
to.</p>

<p>In the later buildings at Babylon, however, lime-mortar
is also used, the transition period being marked by
the employment of both in one and the same building,
and in point of fact Koldewey found that in the case
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 126</span>of one of the walls of a building of Nebuchadnezzar, one
half of the wall was cemented together by means of
asphalt, while in the other half lime-mortar alone was
used. But in the new castle which Nebuchadnezzar
built for himself on the Kasr, the very finest materials
were employed, the bricks being of a pale yellow colour
and extremely hard, contrasting with the bricks used
in his earlier buildings, which are of a reddish-brown
colour and less durable, while in this new structure, pure
white lime-mortar alone is used. Lime-mortar, as well
as mud-cement and bitumen, was employed at Nippur,
as also at Birs-Nimrûd (Borsippa), and the mortar used
has such adhesive properties that the bricks can only
be separated by breaking them, while at Mu&#7731;eyyer
(Ur) a mortar composed of a mixture of lime and ashes
was employed.</p>

<p>In Assyria on the other hand, mortar seems to have
been used more sparingly; when stone was employed as
a building material, generally speaking no cement of any
kind was used, the stones being carefully dressed so as
to permit of no interstices, as for example was found to
be the case with the stone retaining-wall round the ziggurat
at Nimrûd; when ordinary crude bricks were employed,
they were laid in a sufficient state of moisture to
render them adhesive; while when burnt brick was the
material in question, the mortar adopted was a mixture
of clay and water. Bitumen however was by no means
unknown in Assyria, but it was used chiefly under pavements
or the limestone floors of sewers, to prevent leakage
or infiltration.</p>

<h3>STONE</h3>

<p>The use of stone in Babylonia, as a building accessory,
although seldom as a fundamental material, dates from
the most ancient Sumerian times. A very early example
of the use of stone for definitely architectural purposes
in Babylonia is afforded by the pavement upon which a
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 127</span>building at Lagash, found under the structure of Ur-Ninâ,
was erected. The pavement<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> consists of slabs of
limestone, three or four feet long, one and a half to two
feet broad, and about six inches thick. The door-sockets,
again, of some of the earliest rulers of Lagash have been
brought to light, among which may be mentioned those
of the illustrious Eannatum and Entemena, all being
made of marble or some other hard stone, while in Eridu,
one of the most ancient sites of civilization in the Euphrates
Valley, stone seems to have been quite extensively
used. The terraced artificial platform upon which
the temple and city of Eridu were built was buttressed
by a wall of sandstone, and the staircase which led up to
the first stage of the ziggurat was made of polished marble
slabs, which are now lying about casually on the
mound; pieces of agate and alabaster were discovered,
and granite was also employed there. Stone gate-sockets
have been similarly found at Nippur and in the ruins of
other early cities of Babylonia, while both the Semite
Narâm-Sin, and the Sumerian Gudea a little later,
brought heavy blocks of diorite from Magan, or Sinai,
though apparently for sculptural rather than for architectural
purposes.</p>

<p>In the Neo-Babylonian era stone was employed to a
greater extent: the procession pavement of the god
Marduk at Babylon, discovered recently by the Germans,
was formed of slabs of limestone, bearing an inscription
of Nebuchadnezzar, while Herodotus tells us
that the bridge which then united the two banks of the
Euphrates was made of &#8220;very large stones,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> and according
to the classical writers, Strabo and Diodorus, the
famous hanging gardens of Babylon, which Koldewey
would locate to the east of the palace, were supported by
stone architraves. But the stone used only for exceptional
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 128</span>purposes in Babylonia, was re-used time and
again, the ruins being regarded as a quarry, and consequently
the stone has for the most part disappeared entirely.</p>

<p>In Assyria, on the other hand, stone was easily procurable
and therefore readily used, though not to the
extent one would expect, the reason being that the Assyrian
was not an inventor but an imitator of his predecessor,
the Babylonian, who afforded him little or no
example in the working of stone. Accordingly even in
Assyria, stone was for the most part used only for pavements,
plinths and the lining of walls: at times however
it was also used for the retaining walls which enclosed an
artificial mound. The blocks of stone used for this latter
purpose were sometimes of colossal size, measuring even
as much as 6 × 6 × 9 feet and weighing some tons. The
principal kinds of stone employed by the Assyrian architects
were limestone, of varying degrees of hardness, and
alabaster, which latter is often found in Assyria itself a
little below the surface of the soil. Alabaster is a sulphate
of chalk, it is grey in colour, soft, and admits of a
high polish, but it is brittle and deteriorates in course of
time. At Nimrûd (Calah) some of the drainage channels
were covered with large slabs of limestone, and the ziggurat
of Nimrûd, of which only one storey remains, was
faced with a massive stone revetment wall, while occasionally
stone columns appear to have been used, and
one part of a column composed of carved limestone,
some forty inches high and including both the capital
and the upper part of the shaft in one piece has been
actually discovered. Layard further found four bases
of columns made of limestone, on the northern side of
Sennacherib&#8217;s palace at Nineveh (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>). Sometimes
the lintels of doors were made of stone; one such
stone lintel was found by George Smith at the entrance
to the hall in Sennacherib&#8217;s palace, while the sill or threshold
generally, or at all events very frequently, consisted
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 129</span>of alabaster or limestone. Similarly the floors of the more
important rooms were formed of limestone-slabs.</p>

<p>The harder stones were notwithstanding sometimes
employed in Assyria just as limestone was occasionally
used in Babylonia, but as a general rule, in either case
for sculptural rather than building purposes. The well-known
black obelisk of Shalmaneser II (860-825 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>)
already alluded to, was supposed to afford a good example
of the use of volcanic stones in the northern country,
but the material of which it is made is probably alabaster.
A basalt statue of this same king was however
brought to light by the German excavations at Ashur
some few years ago, while the capital of a column found
on the same site, belonging possibly to the time of Tiglath-Pileser
I, gives us an illustration of the use of hard
stones for purely architectural purposes by the Assyrians.
It is uncertain from what quarter they obtained these
harder stones, but basalt and other igneous rocks may be
quarried in the valleys of the streams that poured their
waters into the Tigris and Euphrates, and in the valley
of the Khabour Layard informs us that he discovered
many extinct volcanoes.</p>

<h3>WOOD</h3>

<p>Assyria afforded a better supply of wood than Babylonia,
the latter country being as poor in wood as it is
in stone. The only trees from which beams sufficiently
long to be of any use could be obtained, were the poplar
and the palm tree. Wood being more perishable than
either clay or stone, we naturally do not expect to find
the same amount of material evidence of its usage;
sufficient however has survived the ravages of time to
establish the certainty of its usage in Mesopotamia as a
building material from the earliest to the latest times.
Thus for example at Nippur, Peters found charred beams
of palm-wood which evidently had at one time formed
the roof of the corridor in which it was discovered;
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 130</span>pieces of tamarisk were in like manner found upon the
brick threshold of a doorway, which probably represented
all that remained of the doors and door-posts.
Similarly at Lagash not far from Ur-Ninâ&#8217;s storehouse
were found the charred remains of pillars made of cedar-wood,
which doubtless at one time supported a portico
made of the same material, while Ur-Ninâ himself records
that he fetched wood from the mountains, as did
his descendants of later days. In like manner the roof
of a temple erected by Enannatum I a successor of Ur-Ninâ
was constructed of cedar-wood. So too at Mu&#7731;eyyer
(Ur), large quantities of charred wood were discovered,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
while at Abû Shahrein (Eridu), the casement
wall of the ziggurat is studded with square holes&#8212;three
inches square, which are filled with wood.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> After the establishment
of Babylonian sovereignty over the land of
Amurru, (i.e. Syria and Palestine) by Shar-Gâni-sharri
and Narâm-Sin, the kings of Babylonia regularly obtained
cedar-wood from the Lebanon, as did the early
kings of Egypt. In a room at Nippur used apparently
for storing unbaked tablets in the time of Gimil-Sin
(<i>c.</i> 2350 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) wooden shelves had seemingly been used for
the purpose, while the roof of the famous castle at Babylon,
rebuilt by Nebuchadnezzar, was made of cedar-wood,
as also were the doors, and the portal-like entrance
of one of the buildings at Babylon excavated by
Koldewey was roofed throughout with a ceiling of
timber.</p>

<p>Of the use of wood in Assyria, the wall reliefs would
alone afford ample evidence, for parts of some of the
structures there encountered could only possibly have
been made of wood. Shalmaneser II (860-825 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>)
in commemorating his reconstruction of the temple
of Anu and Adad at Ashur, says that he roofed it
over with beams of cedar, and those of the larger
rooms of the palaces which were not vaulted must have
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 131</span>been roofed with wood, because there is no evidence
of the existence of slabs of stone of sufficient size to
have effected the purpose, and large flat brick roofs
would be out of the question. In like manner Tiglath-Pileser
III states that he made a palace of cedar-wood<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
while Esarhaddon says that the doors of one of the
palaces which he erected for himself were made of cypress-wood
and were covered with silver and copper,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
while in another passage he states that in his building
operations at Babylon he used oaks, terebinths and
palms. At Khorsabad, Place further found fragments of
cedar-beams which had been clearly used for architectural
purposes, and probably formed part of the lintels of
the doorways in which they were found; so too Layard
in the course of his excavations found the charred remains
of wood together with a beam of cedar-wood, all
of which are now in the British Museum. The scantiness
of the remains of wood thus used is adequately
accounted for by the destructibility of that material.</p>

<h3>METAL</h3>

<p>Metal can hardly be said to have been used for purely
architectural purposes at all, and when employed seems
rather to have been added for the adornment of the more
conspicuous parts of the building, than used as an integral
part of the structure. There are, however, one or two
exceptions to this generalization. The sills were sometimes
made of metal in the more luxurious buildings, and
a bronze sill measuring 60 × 20 × 3-1/2 inches, with an inscription
of Nebuchadnezzar has actually come to light,
and is now in the British Museum, while another object
of a singularly unique character, consisting of a bronze
gate-socket set in lead, has similarly found its way to
that famous institution. Herodotus furthermore tells
us in his account of Babylon that the walls had a hundred
gates &#8220;all of bronze; their jambs and lintels were
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 132</span>of the same material.&#8221; Some of the bas-reliefs also exhibit
structures, parts of which must seemingly have
been made of metal: the royal pavilion carved on the
tablet from Abû Habba (Sippar) for example (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXIVa">XIV</a>)
is provided with a curved back wall which at the same
time is bent right over so as to form a roof; this wall
and roof may indeed have been constructed of wood,
but metal would clearly have adapted itself the more
easily to such a form. Of other minor building materials,
such as tools, and nails which played a subsidiary
part in Mesopotamian architecture, we know comparatively
little, though a number of nails have been recovered
from different sites.</p>

<h3>TEMPLES</h3>

<p>It would be quite impossible to give an account of
all the temples and palaces in Mesopotamia, excavated
during the last sixty years, we must therefore
confine ourselves to a brief description of a few
of the better explored buildings, which may with reserve
be regarded as typical. The temples have not
weathered the deteriorating effects of time and climate
so well as the palaces, the reason for which is to be found
in the fact that, generally speaking, the object of the
temple-builder was so far as possible to erect a structure
whose top should metaphorically &#8220;reach unto heaven,&#8221;
whereas the culminating glory of palaces lay not in the
height to which they were reared but in the extent of
ground which they covered.</p>

<p>As to the general plan of Sumerian temples we are still
in a state of ignorance, for on the earliest sites of Babylonian
occupation, few important buildings have been
unearthed. The best preserved and most thoroughly
explored temple in Southern Babylonia is that of En-lil
at Nippur. A Babylonian plan of this once famous
shrine, drawn on a clay tablet and probably belonging
to the first half of the second millennium <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> was discovered
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 133</span>by Haynes in the course of his excavations,
and has been of no small assistance in determining
the general character of this Babylonian temple in its
later reconstructed state, while it may be in reality a
copy of an earlier plan,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> as it accords so well with the
general conclusions to be drawn as to the configuration
of the temple in the time of Shar-Gâni-sharri and Nâram-Sin,
both of whom, and especially the latter, did much
in the way of repairing this ancient fane.</p>

<p>The most prominent feature in connection with the
temple of Nippur as revealed by the excavations, is the
ziggurat, or stage-tower erected by Ur-Engur, king
of Ur (<i>circ.</i> 2400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). The ruined mounds of Nuffar,
or Niffer (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXa">X</a>), are situated on the eastern side
of the Shatt-en-Nîl canal which at one time formed a
line of communication between the Persian Gulf and
the city of Babylon. The mounds in question, the
principal of which marks the site of Ur-Engur&#8217;s ziggurat,
were excavated by Peters, Harper, Haynes and
Hilprecht, under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania,
between the years 1889 and 1900. The tower
surmounts an artificial platform measuring roughly 192
× 127 feet, and in accordance with the usual Babylonian
principle of orientation, has its four corners facing
the cardinal points of the compass. The ziggurat apparently
only had three stages in contradistinction to
the seven-staged tower characteristic of the Babylonian
and Assyrian temples of later days, though Gudea&#8217;s
temple of E-pa erected in honour of his god Nin-girsu
was seven-zoned, which probably means that it was a
seven-staged tower. The ziggurat at Mu&#7731;eyyer<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> (Ur)
excavated by Taylor similarly appears to have been
three-storied, or possibly only two-storied. The lower
storey, protected with a wall of burnt brick four feet in
thickness, was further strengthened with buttresses,
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 134</span>though it should be mentioned that the so-called &#8220;buttresses&#8221;
of the stage towers of Babylonia and Assyria are
in the majority of cases water-conduits for draining the
upper platforms. The second storey, the base of which
is connected with the lower storey by means of a staircase
three yards broad, is composed of bricks entirely
different to those of the lower storey, those of the lower
storey being 11-1/4 × 11-1/4 × 2-1/4 inches, and bearing a small
stamp 3-1/4 inches square, while those of the second are
13 × 13 × 3 inches, the stamp measuring 8 × 4 inches.
The bricks of the first storey were laid in bitumen,
while those of the second&#8212;the bricks on the northern
side being excepted&#8212;are set in a mortar consisting of
lime and ashes. The ascent to the summit of the second
storey was effected by means of an inclined pathway:
from which facts it would appear that the two stories
were not built at the same time. The ziggurat at Abû
Shahrein,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> also excavated by Taylor, is about seventy
feet high, and like that at Mu&#7731;eyyer is cased with a wall
of burnt brick. Here, too, the top of the first storey is
reached by means of a staircase, fifteen feet broad, access
to the summit of the second storey being gained by an
inclined road as at Mu&#7731;eyyer.</p>

<p>The approach to En-lil&#8217;s ziggurat at Nippur is on the
south-east side, and is marked by two walls of burnt
brick, some ten or more feet high and over fifty-two feet
long, a space of about twenty-three feet separating the
two walls from each other, while the causeway itself
which led up to the ziggurat was formed of crude bricks.
The whole of the temple enclosure was surrounded by
a massive wall, and some thirty courses of the bricks
which composed it, still remain. Below the crude-brick
platform upon which the tower was erected, another
pavement of much finer construction, made of large
well-burnt bricks nearly all of which were inscribed with
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 135</span>the stamps of Shar-Gâni-sharri or Narâm-Sin, was discovered.
Directly to the south-east of the ziggurat, a
large chamber about thirty-six feet long, over eleven feet
wide and some eight feet high was found, the floor of
which rested on the platform of Narâm-Sin. The inscribed
bricks proved that this chamber, like the ziggurat
itself was built by Ur-Engur. Immediately below
it, a second chamber of the same kind was discovered,
in which was found a brick stamp of Shar-Gâni-sharri:
around the walls of this chamber ran a narrow shelf on
which some tablets are said to have been found. Haynes
excavated right down to the virgin-soil, and states that
he discovered at least two temples below the pavement
of Narâm-Sin; in the lowest stratum an altar of crude
brick measuring 13 × 8 feet is said to have been
found, on which there was a large deposit of white
ashes. Around the &#8220;altar&#8221; there was a low wall surrounding
the sacred enclosure, on the outside of which
two clay vases some twenty-five inches high, and decorated
with a rope-pattern were brought to light. On
the south-east of the &#8220;altar&#8221; is a crude-brick platform
nearly twenty-three feet square and over nine and a
half feet thick. Around the base of this, Haynes informs
us that he found a number of water-vents, while
beneath this solid mass, he found a drain running underneath
the platform, in the roof of which a true keystone
arch was discovered. This arch was found about
twenty-three feet below the pavement of Ur-Engur and
more than fourteen and a half feet below the platform of
Narâm-Sin. Unfortunately the lowest strata in the
mound have been so much disturbed, and the buildings
so ruthlessly pillaged, that it is impossible to dogmatize
about the dates of all that the excavations have revealed.</p>

<p>With regard to the ziggurat itself, the lowest of its
three stages would appear to have been some twenty
and a half feet high: the slope of the sides upwards is
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 136</span>about one in four, and the second terrace is set back
some thirteen and a half feet from the surface of the
one below. The lower terrace is protected with burnt
brick on the south-east side, while on all the other sides
the foundation is of burnt brick, four courses high and
eight courses wide, surmounted by crude bricks covered
with a plaster consisting of clay and chopped straw,
which helped to preserve the crude brickwork. In the
centre of each of these three sides there was a water-conduit
by which the upper parts of the ziggurat were
drained (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXI">XI</a>); the conduit was made of burnt
bricks, and was ten and a half feet in depth and three
and a half feet span. Around the base of the ziggurat,
was a coating of bitumen which sloped outwards, with
gutters to drain off the water, and thus preserve the
crude bricks from dissolution.</p>

<p>From this brief description of the architectural remains
discovered at Nippur, it will be seen at once, that,
though the information afforded is of supreme importance
and of the utmost value, we are still at a loss as to
the general appearance of an early Babylonian temple,
the temple-tower of the later Ur-Engur of course being
excepted. A restoration of the temple as it probably appeared
in the days of Ur-Engur has been made by Hilprecht
and Fisher, and is reproduced by their kind permission
in Fig. <a href="#fig6">6</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig6" id="fig6" />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&#8212;Restoration of the Temple at Nippur. (After Hilprecht

<p>Of the temple erected by Gudea to the honour and
glory of his god Nin-girsu, we know comparatively little
beyond what he tells us, but from his account, it was
evidently very elaborate, for it contained chambers for
the priests, treasure-houses, granaries, and enclosures
for the various sacrificial victims. In later times there
appear to have been two general types of temple in vogue
in Babylonia, the one having a staged tower as its characteristic
feature, the other being distinguished by its absence.
Of the latter type, we have a good example in
the temple of Nin-makh at Babylon, excavated by the
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 137</span>Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft. The goddess Nin-makh
had been venerated as early as the first dynasty of Lagash,
for in Entemena&#8217;s time temples were already erected
in her honour. Her temple at Babylon was made chiefly
of sun-dried bricks, the four corners being oriented
towards the four points of the compass as usual: it
comprised a courtyard, as well as a number of rooms
some of which were painted, and traces of white decoration
were still visible. Apparently a vestibule led into
a courtyard or hall, around which were situated various
rooms and halls, and into which they also opened. The
inner courtyard offers a point of contrast with the Assyrian
temple at Nimrûd, which has no such interior hall.
Near the ruins of this temple was the famous Ishtar-gate,
the sides of which were formed of massive walls which
were found still preserved to the height of thirty-nine
feet. These walls were decorated with reliefs on enamelled
bricks representing animals of both normal and abnormal
character. There were apparently at least eleven
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 138</span>rows of these reliefs portraying bulls or dragons one
above the other.</p>

<p>But of all Babylonian temples, that of E-temen-an-ki
built by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon upon
the site of an ancient shrine, is by far the most famous.
This temple is called by Herodotus (I, 181) the
temple of Belus, and it was undoubtedly a very magnificent
building both in point of size as well as in
point of splendour. Herodotus in his description states
that it was formed of a solid block of masonry, upon
which was superimposed another block of smaller size,
and so on till there were finally eight blocks in all,
the first or lowest however, was simply the foundation
of the whole ziggurat, and is not to be regarded as
a &#8220;stage&#8221; at all; it was accordingly a perfect seven-staged
tower, the topmost block of which supported a
shrine. The summit was reached by means of an ascent
going round the structure. According to the late George
Smith, whose estimates were based on a Babylonian description
contained in a tablet at one time in his possession,
the height was 300 feet, the sides of its square base
being of the same dimensions; the second storey measured
260 feet square and its height was 60 feet. The
third, fourth and fifth storeys were each 20 feet high,
and measured 200, 170 and 140 feet square respectively.
The variation in height of the different stages forms a
point of contrast with the regularity exhibited by the
ziggurat at Khorsabad, of which the remains of four
stages are still to be seen. Concerning the sixth stage
the Babylonian tablet was apparently silent, while the top
storey supporting the sanctuary of the god was stated
to have measured 80 × 70 feet, and to have been 50
feet high. The seven stages without doubt at one time
shone with the seven planetary colours, as was the case
with the seven-staged tower at Khorsabad, on the lower
remaining stages of which the colours were still found,
the order of the colours being, white for the lowest stage,
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 139</span>black for the next, while the succeeding storeys were
painted blue, yellow, silver, and gold. The ziggurat was
surrounded by an enclosure, some 400 yards square, the
ingress and egress to which was by means of bronze gates.
A double-winged building on the west, presumably the
shrine of the god, contained a couch of gold and a throne
with steps also of gold, while the temple further contained
an image of the god himself, made of solid gold.
The Babylonian account informs us that the temple comprised
two oblong courts, one within the other, the building
as a whole consisting in a series of sanctuaries, although
of course the most conspicuous and therefore
perhaps the most important element in its composition,
was the ziggurat.</p>

<p>But Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s building operations were not
confined to the erection of a temple in honour of Belus:
he rebuilt or restored the great walls of the city of
Babylon, Imgur-Bêl and Nimitti-Bêl, he constructed
temples for Shamash the Sun-god at Sippar and Larsa,
both of which cities had been ancient centres of the
cult of this god, while in Babylon he erected a temple
to the goddess Nin-makh. At Borsippa (Birs-Nimrûd),
he bestowed much attention and care upon the ancient
shrine of Nebo, and his work on this site has
been identified by some scholars with the magnificent
temple described above, to which Herodotus refers at
such length, though as Hommel and Pinches both point
out, the distance of Borsippa from Babylon is rather
against the identification. On the other hand at Borsippa
there are the remains of what once may well have
been the magnificent temple in question, while at the
city of Babylon itself no such remains are to be seen;
and in regard to the objection raised to the identification
of these remains with the famous temple of Belus
on the ground that Borsippa was too far distant, it must
be recollected that we do not really know how far the
city extended, whether in fact it may not have even included
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 140</span>Borsippa within its boundaries, for, according to
Herodotus, the circuit of the city measured some fifty-six
miles. Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s own account of his architectural
achievements is inscribed on a number of barrel-shaped
clay cylinders and on the well-known East
India House Inscription.</p>

<p>The Assyrian temples seem for the most part to have
conformed to the same general type as that prevalent
in Babylonia. One of the earliest explored, and at
present perhaps the most famous, is that excavated by
Layard at Nimrûd (Calah).<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> It consisted in an outer
courtyard, from which the worshipper entered into a
vestibule measuring 46 feet by 19 feet,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> beyond which
there was a side chamber and a hall 47 feet long and 31
feet broad, ending in a recess paved with a huge alabaster
slab, 21 feet long, 16 feet 7 inches broad and 1 foot 1 inch
thick, in which was probably set the image of the god;
many stone slabs of a religious character were found
within, while upon the stone pavement a history of the
reign of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal was inscribed. The main entrance
was decorated and protected with winged human-headed
lions 16-1/2 feet high and 15 feet long, whose rôle
of guardianship at the portals of the king&#8217;s palace is
thus exchanged for a yet higher and more exalted position
of trust, while the entrance into the side room
was covered with reliefs portraying the god in the act
of expelling a malicious demon. The side entrance
was thirty feet to the right of the main entrance, and the
chamber into which it led was connected by two corridors
with the vestibule and the main hall. It was to
the right of this smaller entrance that the famous arch-topped
monolith of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal was discovered
(cf. Pl. <a href="#pIII">III</a>). A short distance from the building just
described, and on the very edge of the artificial platform,
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 141</span>another temple was discovered. The entrance was
guarded by two colossal lions (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXVI">XXVI</a>), 8 feet
high and 13 feet long, and the gateway which was about
8 feet wide was paved with one inscribed slab. In
front of the lions were two altars similar to the altar
in the Khorsabad relief reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>, C. The
gateway led into a room 57 feet long and 25 feet broad,
ending in a recess paved with an enormous alabaster
slab inscribed on both sides and measuring 19-1/2 feet by
12 feet. It was in this temple that the statue of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal
was discovered (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXIV">XXIV</a>).</p>

<p>The resemblance which the staged towers of Mesopotamia
bear to the pyramids of Egypt naturally led to an
interrogation as to whether they resembled them also in
regard to the use to which they were put. Accordingly
Layard endeavoured to answer the question, which had
already been categorically answered by Ctesias and
Ovid, by making cuttings in a ziggurat at Nimrûd
with a view to ascertaining whether they contained
voids in which the bodies of kings or heroes might
have at one time been deposited, whether in fact the
ziggurats were primarily tombs like the pyramids of
Mi&#7779;raim. The possibility of such being the case was
proved by the discovery of a vault, on a level with the
platform itself, measuring 100 feet in length, 6 feet in
breadth and 12 feet in height, though if this had actually
been the last resting-place of a departed king,
it had been completely rifled. Of the ziggurat in question,
but one storey remained, protected by a massive
facing of stone, and about twenty feet high; the stones
seem to have been laid together without any mortar,
as was so often the case in Assyrian masonry.</p>

<p>Another excellent example of an Assyrian temple is
the Anu-Adad temple at Ashur, recently excavated by
the Deutsche Orient Gesellschaft. The code of Khammurabi
shows that this city was in existence at all events
as early as his time, and the German excavations have
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 142</span>proved that it did not lose its importance when the seat
of government was removed thence to Calah (Nimrûd)
about 1300 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, but on the contrary continued to be a
royal city and maintained its importance till the seventh
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and possibly later.</p>

<p>The temple of Anu-Adad was founded by Ashur-resh-ishi
(<i>circ.</i> 1140<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>). It consisted of a rectangular terrace
to which access was gained by a doorway flanked
by towers: beneath the terrace there were a number of
rooms. The two temple-towers were separated from
each other by a long passage, on each side of which were
four small rooms surrounding a large chamber in the
middle, which may well have been the sanctuary. One
of these large chambers was dedicated to Anu, and the
other to Adad. The two temple-towers were according
to Andrae four-staged ziggurats, and no doubt upon the
topmost storey there was a shrine, as in the temple of
Belus at Babylon. Many of the bricks composing the
towers were inscribed as was nearly always the case.
Tiglath-Pileser I (1100<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>) the son and successor of
Ashur-resh-ishi had occasion to repair or rebuild this
temple, and he records that he raised its towers to heaven
and made firm its battlements with baked brick.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> His
account reads as follows:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the beginning of my government Anu and Adad,
the great gods, my lords, who love my priestly dignity,
demanded of me the restoration of this their
sacred dwelling. I made bricks, and I cleared the
ground, until I reached the artificial flat terrace upon
which the old temple had been built. I laid its foundation
upon the solid rock and incased the whole place
with brick like a fireplace, overlaid on it a layer of
fifty bricks in depth, and built upon this the foundations
of the Temple of Anu and Adad of large square
stones. I built it from foundation to roof larger and
grander than before, and erected also two great temple
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 143</span>towers, fitting ornaments of their great divinities.
The splendid temple, a brilliant and magnificent dwelling,
the habitation of their joys, the house for their
delight, shining as bright as the stars on heaven&#8217;s firmament
and richly decorated with ornaments through the
skill of my artists, I planned, devised and thought out,
built and completed. I made its interior brilliant like
the dome of the heavens; decorated its walls, like the
splendour of the rising stars, and made it grand with resplendent
brilliancy. I reared its temple towers to heaven
and completed its roof with burned brick; located
therein the upper terrace containing the chambers of
their great divinities; and led into its interior Anu
and Adad, the great gods, and made them dwell in
this their lofty home, thus gladdening the heart of
their great divinities. I also cleared the site of the
treasure-house of Adad, my lord, which the same
Shamshi-Adad, priest of Ashur, son of Ishme-Dagan,
likewise priest of Ashur, had built and which had
fallen into decay and ruins, and rebuilt it from foundation
to roof with burned brick, making it more beautiful
and much firmer than before. I slaughtered clean
animals therein as a sacrifice to Adad, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>This same king, with the prescience characteristic of
Assyrian monarchs, prays that, in the event of the
building falling into disrepair, a future king may restore
them, and he further begs that such king may
anoint his own inscribed tablets and his foundation-cylinders
with oil. His prayer was justified by after
events, for in Shalmaneser II&#8217;s (860-825 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) time, the
temple had already suffered from the effects of time and
climate, and that king consequently rebuilt it throughout.
Shalmaneser&#8217;s reconstruction was not so aspiring
in its dimensions as that of Ashur-resh-ishi, the original
founder of the temple. He erected two temple-towers
(cf. Fig. <a href="#fig7">7</a>) parallel to those of his predecessor,
differing however from those of Ashur-resh-ishi, according
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 144</span>to Andrae, in being panelled instead of plain,
as was the case with the ziggurat (the so-called &#8220;Observatory&#8221;)
at Khorsabad and the ziggurat of Belus at Babylon.
But Shalmaneser was not the last king to whom
was accorded the privilege of repairing this ancient
fane: Sargon 722-705(<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>) the successor of Shalmaneser
IV, and the immediate predecessor of Sennacherib,
also found occasion to devote himself to this
work of piety, and in the courtyard of Shalmaneser
II, the pavement-tiles nearly all bear the name of Sargon,
a permanent testimony to his sense of religious
obligation in this matter. The unique feature about
this temple is its double ownership.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span> (After Andrae, <i>Der Anu-Adad Tempel, Tafel IX</i>.)</p></div>

<p>Another temple recently excavated at Ashur by Koldewey
and Andrae, is the temple erected by Sin-shar-ishkun
in honour of the god Nebo. Sin-shar-ishkun
was the last king of Assyria and reigned about 615<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>
This temple, which comprised a considerable number of
rooms of various shapes and sizes, was separated into
two main divisions, both of which consisted in a group
of apartments leading into a main court, the two courts
being connected with each other. Access to the temple
from outside was gained through a door and vestibule
leading into the northern court, though possibly the
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 145</span>southern court with which the latter is connected at
one time had a similar entrance.</p>

<p>The southern court measures over ninety feet in
length and about thirty-seven feet in breadth, and is surrounded
by rooms on its southern, eastern and northern
sides, while on the northern side it is connected with the
northern court. But it is on the western side of this
southern court that the main temple rooms are located.
Thanks to the excellent state of preservation in which
the brickwork foundation of the walls was found, the excavators
were able to determine the ground-plan of two
parallel series of rooms, to each of which access from the
court was gained by an entrance-gate provided with a
tower; both the northern and southern series of rooms
contained first of all a broad room which communicated
with a long room, at the extreme end of which was a recess
for the statue of the god. The recess at the end of
the long room in the northern series is so well preserved
that the general plan of its reconstruction is quite certain.
The limestone paved pedestal in the recess was ascended
by a small double flight of low steps, the steps being
similarly paved with limestone and numbering four. All
these rooms including the southern and western corridors
and the southern court were paved with brickwork,
some of the bricks bearing the building inscription of
Sin-shar-ish-kun, and the bricks in both the southern
and the northern broad rooms were inscribed &#8220;temple
of Nebo,&#8221; thereby proving that this whole part of the
building belonged to the temple of that god, and that his
temple was thus double in character.</p>

<p>Sin-shar-ishkun had evidently not been above utilizing
the building materials of his predecessors, for one of
the door-sockets bears the name of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal, while
among other inscribed objects discovered were fragments
of hollow terra-cotta cylinders and prisms as well
as clay cones bearing an inscription of Sin-shar-ishkun.
The ground-plan of the southern division of this temple
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 146</span>of Nebo corresponds in all essential particulars to that
of the normal Assyrian temple, of which the outstanding
characteristics&#8212;apart from the ziggurat&#8212;were the
broad-room, the hall with a recess for the god&#8217;s statue,
a group of surrounding rooms and a corridor.</p>

<p>The most famous temple at Ashur was that of the
god Ashur himself, but unfortunately it is badly preserved,
and is consequently of less archæological importance
than the Anu-Adad temple or the temple of Nebo.
One point of interest about the ancient temple of Ashur,
is that the rooms appear to have been broad rather than
long. In the oldest part of the building, an alabaster
block<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> bearing an inscription of twenty-four lines written
in archaic characters was discovered. The characters
somewhat resemble those found in Irishum&#8217;s inscriptions
and are similar to the characters used in early
Babylonian inscriptions, while like them, they read
longitudinally and not laterally, but the lines run from
left to right instead of from right to left, and in this they
resemble a few inscriptions found at Tellô.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> This alabaster
block is possibly the oldest Assyrian inscription
as yet brought to light. In the fore-court of this same
temple, some fragments of a diorite sculpture with small
figures similar to those of the Khammurabi period were
found.</p>

<p>The best-preserved ziggurat in Mesopotamia is that
which was discovered at Khorsabad; four stages of this
tower still remain, and the colours with which they were
painted are yet visible. It is in close proximity to
though not in immediate connection with the group of
buildings formerly regarded as the harem of the palace,
but recently shown by Koldewey<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> to be in reality a group
of temples (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig24">24</a> <span class="smcap">B</span>). The argument upon which
the harem-theory was based was the fact that this block of
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 147</span>buildings is separate from the palace, but this argument
could be used with even greater force in support of the
temple theory, while its proximity to the ziggurat, and
the general correspondence in form and shape of the
several buildings which it comprises, to the normal
Assyrian temple as revealed by the excavations, makes
Koldewey&#8217;s contention a practical certainty. Furthermore,
though the ziggurat, as is the case at Borsippa, is
not connected with the theoretical &#8220;temple-complex,&#8221;
there seems to be no doubt they belong to each other
as there is no room elsewhere in the neighbourhood
for a temple proper, and the adjacent parts of the palace
were certainly used for secular and not religious purposes.
The block would appear to contain three temples
the entrance to each of which was through a central
court; the temples consisted in a broad-room or vestibule,
a long-room or hall at the end of which was
another room&#8212;presumably the sanctuary where the
statue of the god was enshrined. The entrance to the
sanctuary from the hall was through a broad opening
and up some stairs.</p>

<p>In addition to these salient parts of the building there
were various subordinate rooms, which in one temple
flanked the right side, in another the left, and in the
third both sides of the main hall, these rooms being
connected in one case with the broad-room, the hall and
the sanctuary, in the second with the hall and sanctuary,
and in the third with the hall only. Sometimes they
further have surrounding corridors; it will be thus
seen that though they show considerable variation
among themselves, they exhibit the same general type,
a type totally different from that to which the Assyrian
palaces and houses conform, the general shape of which
was broad rather than long.</p>

<p>But in spite of the general similarity of Assyrian
temples, the earlier buildings differ from those of
later date in at least one important respect; in the
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 148</span>former the sanctuary is simply a deep niche in the back
wall of the main long-room or hall, while in the later
temples of Sargon, the niche has been developed into a
special sanctuary chamber.</p>

<p>It has been already demonstrated that the ziggurats
in Mesopotamia did not by any means all conform to
the same plan; not only did the number of their stages
vary however, but occasionally their shape also. As a
rule they were square, or at all events rectangular, but
the ziggurat excavated at El Hibba by the Deutsche
Orient Gesellschaft proved to be an exception to this
general rule. The tower in question is circular in form,
and comprises two stages; it is not built on an artificial
mound, but on the natural soil, and is still standing
to the height of twenty-four feet. The diameter
of the first storey<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> is over four hundred feet, while that
of the upper storey is only a little over three hundred
feet. The last-named is protected with a casement-wall
of burnt bricks laid in bitumen, and the upper surfaces
of both stories were coated with the same material
in order to protect them from the disintegrating
effects of the rain. The structure was drained by means
of canals made of burnt bricks, which served the further
purpose of strengthening the lower storey, and acted in
fact as a buttress. A number of clay cones or nails
were found on the surface of the upper storey, similar
to those found at the foot of the Nippur ziggurat, but
none of them apparently bore any inscription.</p>

<h3>PALACES</h3>

<p>Other buildings in Babylonia of a more secular character
have been preserved in a more satisfactory state
than those specifically dedicated to the gods, but the
royal palaces themselves have for the most part undergone
such a course of reconstruction that it is very difficult
to determine the precise form which the original
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 149</span>building assumed. Ur-Ninâ has bequeathed to us the
remains of an elaborate building which he erected at his
royal city Lagash, but it appears to be a storehouse
rather than an integral part of a palace; Ur-bau and
Gudea some centuries later have also left unmistakable
signs of their building activity at this famous city of
the past. In the course of the excavation of a large palace
in one of the ruined mounds of Tellô, many bricks inscribed
with the name of Gudea were found, and this
discovery not unnaturally led to the hasty conclusion
that this elaborate building so wonderfully preserved,
was actually the royal residence of this long deceased
ruler, but a closer investigation revealed the presence of
other bricks bearing the name of one, Hadadnadinakhe,
in both Greek and Aramæan characters, thereby proving
conclusively that the building in question belonged to
the Parthian period and could not be assigned to a date
earlier than the latter half of the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> The
bricks belonging to Gudea&#8217;s early building had been re-used
as material for this later structure, a practice to
which recourse was frequently had in Mesopotamia.
Parts however of Gudea&#8217;s early building were actually
incorporated in the Parthian palace, the best preserved
of which are a gateway (cf. Pl. <a href="#pVa">V</a>) and a portion of a
tower, while underneath one corner of the palace, part
of a wall erected by Ur-bau, one of Gudea&#8217;s immediate
predecessors, was discovered.</p>

<p>Another palace of great fame was that of Nebuchadnezzar
at Babylon, known as the El-&#7730;asr (cf. p. <a href="#Page_69">69</a>). This
palace has been excavated by Koldewey and Andrae. The
outer wall was made of bricks stamped with the name
of Nebuchadnezzar, and was some 23-1/2 feet thick, the
inner wall also made of brick being over 44 feet thick,
while the space between the two walls, nearly 70 feet,
was filled in with sand and other material, the total
thickness thus being nearly 136-1/2 feet. The burnt bricks
of which the retaining walls were composed were laid in
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 150</span>asphalt and are so compactly joined that it is impossible
to separate them into their layers. The &#7730;asr mound,
which represents a new suburb of the city of Babylon itself,
has revealed nothing earlier than the seventh century.
Ashur-bani-pal (668-626<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>) built a temple here
which has been duly excavated, but Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s
palace is the principal building which has been discovered
on this famous site. Before the time of Nebuchadnezzar
there had seemingly been a palace here, which had undergone
a course of reconstruction at the hands of Nabopolassar
(625-604<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>) the founder of the Neo-Babylonian
dynasty, but it subsequently suffered grievously from
an inundation of the Euphrates, and was accordingly
repaired and enlarged by Nebuchadnezzar who rebuilt it
with burnt brick; so enduring was his work that the
lower portions of it have remained in position till our
own day.</p>

<p>The interior of the palace consisted in a great number
of rooms arranged around courtyards. The large hall,
situated on the south of the main court, had a niche in its
southern wall and was further provided with three doors
in its northern wall, where traces were also to be found of
what may have been at one time a colonnade. The roof
of the palace was made of cedar-wood, as were also the
doors, which latter were covered with bronze, just as was
the case with the famous gates at Balâwât (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig43">43</a>). The
thresholds were made of the same metal, as also were
the steps in the temple E-zida at Borsippa, one of which
has come down to us and bears this king&#8217;s name, while
gold, silver and precious stones of various kinds were
used with an unsparing prodigality in the decoration of
the royal residence.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar further erected another building
on the northern side of the wall, which was apparently a
fortress, and was connected with the palace. According
to the India House Inscription, and the statement of
Berosus the Babylonian historian (about 300<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>) whose
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 151</span>history unfortunately is lost, but from which extracts
have been handed down to us by Josephus, this building
was completed in the incredibly short period of fifteen
days.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig8" id="fig8" />
<img src="images/fig8.jpg" width="500" height="310" alt="Restoration of Sargon's Palace" />
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>&#8212;Restoration of &#8220;Sargon&#8217;s Palace&#8221; at Khorsabad. (After Place.)</p></div>

<p>Assyrian palaces are however in a better state of preservation
than those of Babylonia, and afford more material
for the study of Mesopotamian architecture. First and
foremost of these must be mentioned that built by Sargon
(722-705<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>) at Khorsabad (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a>). The palace
in question was built upon an artificial mound, like most
of the important edifices in Babylonia and Assyria, these
mounds serving a more practical purpose in Southern
Mesopotamia, as by their means the buildings themselves
were thus elevated beyond the reach of the waters
of the inundating Euphrates. The mounds, sometimes
formed of a mass of crude brick, sometimes of sand,
gravel and other material, were kept together and protected
by a casement wall of either burnt brick or stone.
The revetment-walls at Khorsabad, which were formed of
blocks of stone weighing sometimes as much as twenty-three
tons and measuring 6 × 6 × 9 feet, gradually become
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 152</span>thinner towards the top. The inner face of this stone
wall in immediate contact with the crude brick mass,
was left rough, which added to the general coherency
of the whole. The total height of the wall at Khorsabad
was some 60 feet, the foundations measuring 9
feet, and the retaining wall 46 feet, a parapet of 5 feet
making up the total of 60 feet. When the roof was
flat, it seems to have generally been surmounted by a
parapet the top of which was crenelated. Nearly all the
buildings portrayed on Assyrian bas-reliefs exhibit this
crenelation, which was apparently a peculiar characteristic
of Mesopotamian architecture, and indeed so popular
did this style of arrangement become in later times,
that even the tops of altars and stelæ were sometimes
crenelated (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>, C). Crenelated buildings are however
not found in Babylonia till the time of Gudea and
the dynasty of Ur (<i>circ.</i> 2450 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). The foundation-mound
upon which the brick town-wall of Dûr-sharrukîn
(Khorsabad) was built was similarly faced with stone,
the mound itself consisting of stones and rubble, but
inside the palace, stone was only used for lining the
walls, for the flooring of the more important rooms,
and for the shafts, capitals and bases of columns, and
other architectural accessories, the main body of the
edifice being built entirely of brick. The outer walls
of buildings were as a rule fortified with &#8220;buttresses,&#8221;
made of stronger and more durable material than the
walls themselves, while apparently the only foundations
were the artificial mounds upon which the buildings were
constructed. Unfortunately but little is known as to the
internal arrangements of the buildings, and we are in
considerable doubt even regarding the manner in which
the various rooms were roofed.</p>

<p>The rooms in Sargon&#8217;s palace are nearly all rectangular
in shape, sometimes square, but generally very long in
proportion to their breadth. The walls of the rooms were
phenomenally thick and vary from twelve to twenty-eight
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 153</span>feet. The roofs of these long chambers must have either
been vaulted, or else constructed of timber-beams, though
the former would have been the more serviceable in a climate
characterized by extreme heat on the one hand and
extreme cold on the other, for the thick vaulting would
alike avert the scorching rays of the summer&#8217;s sun and
the penetrating cold of a rigorous winter, while the
discovery of an enormous quantity of broken bricks,
débris and rubble, and the corresponding absence of
any trace of wood in the excavated rooms supports the
theory that the roofs were made of clay rather than of
wood; and lastly, the only wood easily procurable
would seemingly have been quite inadequate to support
the strain of a superimposed flat roof of mud.
Victor Place furthermore actually discovered the remains
of vaults which had collapsed, while the extensive
use of the arch both in the city walls of Khorsabad
as well as in the drainage of the palace furnishes an
additional argument and increases the probability of
the theory yet the more. The disappearance of any
trace of wood in the rooms themselves might have been
explained by the frailty and non-enduring character of
that material, but near the doorways, which obviously
could not have been formed of clay, or stone, fragments
of wood as well as door panels are said to have been
found, and without doubt, had the ceilings of the
rooms been made of wood also, similar evidence of the
fact would be forthcoming. Place further alludes to
the discovery of rollers made of limestone in some of
the chambers: these rollers may have been used to
flatten and solidify the pisé-roofs after a downpour of
rain, and thereby been the means of preventing the
dissolution and general collapse of this integral part of
the structure. But these clay roofs however unsatisfactory
they may have been in days gone by from the architectural
standpoint, have proved of incalculable value to
the archæologist of to-day, for to the softness of the
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 154</span>material of which they were composed is due the perfect
preservation of the sculptures and statues which they
were destined to entomb for so long a period.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the partition-walls of the rooms
exhibit the same extraordinary solidity noticeable, alike
in the outer walls of the palace and in those of the city,
the thinnest being some ten feet thick. The massiveness
of these partition walls bears out the theory that
the roofs were not formed of wooden beams but of clay
vaulting, and is thus an additional piece of evidence to
that afforded by the absence of any trace of wood in
the chambers themselves on the one hand and the discovery
of fragments of wood in the doorways on the
other; for the only available explanation and general
<i>raison d&#8217;être</i> of such thick interior walls is that vaulted
roofs made of soft clay could only be supported by walls
of more than ordinary solidity. Doubtless the vaulted
roofing was also a determining factor in the shape and
general contour which the rooms assumed, and it is to
the dearth of wood suitable for building purposes, and
the consequent use of clay for roofing as well as for other
parts of the structure that we are to ascribe the narrowness
of most of the chambers, which in truth resemble
galleries more than halls or rooms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig9" id="fig9" />
<img src="images/fig9.jpg" width="500" height="308" alt="From an Assyrian Bas-relief." />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>&#8212;From an Assyrian Bas-relief. (After Layard, Ser. 2, Pl. 17.)</p></div>

<p>It must not however be supposed that all the rooms in
Sargon&#8217;s palace or in the palaces of other Assyrian kings
were one and all shaped like passages, or that they were
one and all roofed with barrel-shaped vaults. Square
rooms were discovered in the palace which we are discussing,
some of which were of no mean dimensions and
measured forty-eight feet each way; these clearly could
not have been covered with barrel vaulting, while the
difficulty of procuring timber of sufficient length would
make itself felt more in the case of a large square chamber,
than in an elongated gallery. The problem therefore
resolves itself into an inquiry as to what other modes
of roofing were adopted by the Assyrians apart from
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 155</span>roofs made of wooden beams which were apparently
only used in exceptional cases, and barrel vaults,
which would have been out of the question in these
large square chambers. It is here that the bas-reliefs
adorning the walls of the royal palaces come to
our aid. On one of these reliefs from Kouyunjik
(cf. Fig. <a href="#fig9">9</a>) are portrayed a number of buildings
surmounted by domes of varying shapes and sizes,
which prove conclusively that the Assyrians of Sennacherib&#8217;s
time had evolved the art of constructing
domed roofs, or perhaps we should say borrowed the
art from their mother-country, as the principle of the
domed roof seems to have been known in Babylonia
in the pre-Sargonic times, for the American excavations
at Bismâya have disclosed an oval-shaped room of the
Sumerian period, provided with a domed roof of which
the larger portions still remained, and without doubt the
square chambers in Sargon&#8217;s palace at Khorsabad as well
as those in the palaces of other Assyrian kings were
roofed in this way. The buildings on the right (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig9">9</a>)
have flat roofs, while those on the left have either hemispherical
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 156</span>cupolas, or conical-shaped domes; most of the
doors are rectangular in shape, two of them however are
arched like the famous gates at Khorsabad. These
rounded roofs are to be seen all over the East even at
the present day, so persistent is the influence of custom
and habit when both are but the offspring of the natural
environment of climate and owe their very origin to the
great mother of invention.</p>

<h3>PRIVATE HOUSES</h3>

<p>Of the arrangement of private houses in Babylonia
we know comparatively little. Taylor excavated a small
house of uncertain date at Mu&#7731;eyyer, and a plan of
some chambers at Abû Shahrein was also made out.
The house at Mu&#7731;eyyer was erected on an artificial
mound of crude brick upon which a pavement of burnt
brick was laid, the house itself being built of the same
material. The walls were very irregular, but the general
plan of the building seems to have been cruciform. The
outer layer of bricks was apparently set in bitumen, mud-mortar
being used for the remainder, while the floor
which was made of burnt brick like the walls, was laid in
bitumen. In regard to the doorways, two of them consisted
in arched vaults, the arch being semicircular and
made of wedge-shaped bricks, and the charred remains
of wooden rafters or beams were found within. The outside
of the house was decorated with perpendicular
grooves, or &#8220;stepped recesses,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> and many of the bricks
were coated with enamel or gypsum, and were inscribed.</p>

<p>The external decoration of a building at Warka
(Erech) excavated by Loftus consisted on the other hand
of series of coloured clay cones<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> embedded in mud or
plaster and arranged in various patterns, with their circular
bases outwards. The patterns were mostly triangular,
striped, diamond-shaped, or zigzags, and the wall
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 157</span>of which they formed a part measured thirty feet in
length. The flat part of this wall projected one foot nine
inches beyond the semicircular half columns which occurred
at intervals as in the Wuswas façade.</p>

<p>The rooms excavated at Abû Shahrein were built of
crude brick, the walls being covered with a plaster on
the inside and painted. In one of these chambers the
walls were decorated with white, black, and red bands,
about three inches broad, while in another there was a
crude red picture of a man holding a bird on his wrist,
and a smaller figure standing close by.</p>

<p>The buildings uncovered by the German excavations
at Fâra appear to be chiefly characterized by the feebleness
of the walls and the elaboration of the drainage
system. The general plan of these brick buildings consisted
in a central court surrounded by chambers of very
small dimensions. Private houses, like palaces, were
often occupied over and over again: thus at Nippur
some of the houses excavated by Haynes had been
occupied at least three times over, while in one of
them three distinctly different doorways were visible,
the lowest and therefore the earliest being roofed by a
segmental arch. But other buildings of quite a different
shape and character were found both at Surghul and
Fâra; these buildings are not rectangular but circular
in form, and measure from six and a half to sixteen
feet across. These rotundas, which are particularly
numerous at Fâra, were surmounted by arched vaults,
and one of them was found to contain four skulls.
For what these circular structures were used it is difficult
to say. We know something about the ordinary
houses of later times from the classical writers:
Herodotus for example informs us that the houses
were generally lofty, having three or even four stories
(Herod. I, 180), while Strabo tells us that the roofs of
the houses were vaulted. The latter writer informs us
that the pillars of the house&#8212;when such existed&#8212;consisted
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 158</span>in the trunks of palm trees, around which wisps
of rushes were entwined, the whole being thus coated
with some kind of plaster and then painted (Strab.
XVI, I, 85).</p>

<p>Of the private houses in Assyria we are little better
informed than of those in Babylonia. The German excavations
at &#7730;alat Sher&#7731;at (Ashur) have however thrown
some light on the subject. The foundation-walls of
the houses discovered on this site showed that they conformed
in general plan to that of the old Babylonian
house as illustrated at Fâra. The foundations themselves
present some novel varieties to the student of
Mesopotamian architecture; the foundation-walls referred
to were sunk down through the amassed débris
with which the plateau had been covered, to the rock
bottom; and these walls were covered with a layer of
stones, upon which the actual walls of the building were
superimposed. One of the houses in question measured
roughly 86 × 61 feet, and is rectangular in shape. As at
Fâra the rooms surround a central court. On the south
side of the building two narrow corridors run east and
west, and are traceable in the foundations, access to the
court being gained only by passing through the outer
corridor and turning two corners.</p>

<p>In the débris beneath this house were found various
graves of the capsule type.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>The drains of the early Babylonians were either made
of bricks, or else of baked clay rings. Of the larger type
of drain or water conduit generally used to drain the
upper stages of ziggurats, we have a good example in Pl. <a href="#pXI">XI</a>.
Similar drains were discovered by Loftus at Erech,
though he mistook them for supporting buttresses,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> to
which they bear a striking resemblance. In the temple
court at Nippur numerous drains of the second class
were discovered. These were constructed of terra-cotta
rings set one on the top of the other, and sometimes
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 159</span>provided with a bell-shaped top, while occasionally it was
surmounted by a terra-cotta floor,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> as in Fig. <a href="#fig10">10</a>. The
average diameter of the rings composing this drain was
two feet and three-quarters, and it descended some six
and a half feet. At Bismâya a drain consisting of round
tiles about eight inches in diameter was discovered,
while similar drains made of terra-cotta rings superimposed
one on the top of the other were discovered by
Taylor at Mu&#7731;eyyer (Ur). Frequently these shafts were
double as in the illustration (Fig. <a href="#fig11">11</a>). The rings composing
this drain were two feet in diameter and about
a foot and a half broad, and in some instances they were
cemented together by means of a thin layer of bitumen.
&#8220;For about a foot right round these drain-pipes and
throughout their whole length, were pieces of broken
pottery, the more effectually to drain the mound.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>
Over the mouth of the top ring, which is of a different
shape to the others, were layers of perforated bricks
leading up to the top of the mound. Sometimes these
drains consist of as many as forty of these rings. Numerous
drains made of both bricks and tiles were discovered
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 160</span>at Bismâya, while the drainage system at Fâra
and other early Babylonian sites seems to have been very
extensive.</p>

<p>The main drains in Babylonia and Assyria frequently
assumed the form of vaulted aqueducts. Concerning
the drainage of the inner rooms, the palace
of Sargon at Khorsabad is our best source of information.
Nearly all of the rooms were drained by a hole
cut in a stone in the centre of the floor towards which the
brick floor gradually sloped; the water passed through
the hole into a circular brick conduit, which descended
into a horizontal drain connected with the main vaulted
drain to which reference will be made later on (cf. p. <a href="#Page_174">174</a>).</p>

<p>Windows, which to our idea form one of the most
important parts of a building, were apparently taken into
little account by the Babylonians and Assyrians. In
the case of one-storied buildings the only windows seem
to have been skylights. At all events Place discovered
terra-cotta cylinders in several of the rooms at Khorsabad,
which according to him, must have formed a part
of the roof through which air and a modicum of light
was admitted into the chamber. The buildings represented
on the bas-reliefs are indeed provided with small
openings, but these appear to be embrasures rather than
windows properly so-called. But in any case, even if
windows were cut in the walls, the extreme thickness of
the latter would have excluded nearly all light.</p>

<h3>THE COLUMN</h3>

<p>The column never seems to have occupied a prominent
position in the history of Mesopotamian architecture,
a fact which was again due to the dearth of stone
and wood; there is however sufficient evidence to
prove that it was certainly not unknown, though it was
not very frequently employed. In modern architecture
the column forms the main support of arches, but in
Babylonian and Assyrian architecture the archivolts and
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 161</span>pendentives of the arch are generally supported by thick
walls; this fact is testified to alike by the remains of
ancient buildings and also by the figured representations
of such buildings found on the bas-reliefs.</p>

<p>Probably the best examples of an early Babylonian
column are those discovered by De Sarzec at Tellô in
1881, though strictly speaking they are not columns,
but piers formed by the union of four circular columns
(cf. Fig. <a href="#fig12">12</a>). The piers are composed of circular, semicircular,
or triangular bricks, which bear an inscription,
<span class="figright350" style="width: 350px;"><a name="fig12" id="fig12" />
<img src="images/fig12.jpg" width="350" height="245" alt="Déc. en Chald." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span> (Cf. <i>Déc. en Chald.</i>, Pl 53, 2.)</span></span>
from which
we gather that the
new construction
of which they presumably
formed
a part was largely
made of cedar-wood,
a statement
confirmed by the
discovery of fragments
of this
wood amid the
ruins.</p>

<p>Evidence of the very early use of the column on the
same site was forthcoming in the discovery of a series of
eight brick bases, situated some thirteen feet from the
ancient building of Ur-Ninâ, the charred remains of
pillars of cedar-wood by which these bases were once surmounted
being still visible. Probably the most familiar
example of the use of the column in Babylonia, afforded
by the excavations, is that of the Court of columns at Nippur
(cf. Pl. <a href="#pXa">X</a>). This court is over forty-eight feet square;
its floor consists of a thick pavement made of unburnt
bricks, and is over six feet in depth; around three of
the sides of this square, Peters tells us, ran a kind of
edging formed by a double row of burnt bricks, out of
which arose four brick columns, round in shape, but resting
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 162</span>on square brick pillars which descended some three
feet or so below the surface; the fourth side was without
doubt similarly occupied with columns, but nearly every
trace of even the foundations of them has been washed
away owing to the slope of the hill. On the other sides of
the platform the columns remain standing to a height of
about three feet; they appear to have tapered upwards,
the diameter at the base being just over three feet. They
were built of bricks especially made for the purpose: these
bricks, in shape, are segments of circles, the apexes of
which are truncated, and the hollow thus left in the centre
of the circle compounded of these deformed segments
was filled in with fragments of bricks. The segmentary
bricks are well baked though somewhat brittle, and they
were laid in mortar. According to Peters, these columns
were carefully dressed with a sharp instrument, to remove
any irregular projections there might be owing
to the malformation of any of the component bricks.
The columns are moreover not arranged with mathematical
accuracy, being only roughly equidistant from one
another. The corner-columns differ from the others
in being half-round and half-square. Peters dates this
colonnade in the second millennium and assigns it to the
Cassite period. Hilprecht however believes it to be a
product of the Parthian times, and dates it about 300<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span></p>

<p>But yet other columns were found at Nippur, some
rectangular and oblong in shape, others assuming an
oval form, both kinds however being made of brick
like the columns in the court. In one room in a building
close to the court, two columns were found built
into the wall, and two more round columns on square
bases, the latter being composed of four courses of
bricks, and resting on a foundation of mud-brick. The
circumference of these round columns is over twelve
feet. On the south-east of the court the remains of
another pair of round columns of gigantic size were
discovered; the base of one of these was found still
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 163</span>in its original position, while the remains of the shafts
lay strewn about promiscuously. The diameter of these
columns at the base must have been between six and
seven feet, that is to say more than double the size of
the columns in the court itself.</p>

<p>Tellô and Nippur are however not the only sites
which have yielded evidence of the use of the column
in the Babylonia of antiquity. Loftus in his excavations
at the Wuswas mound at Warka (Erech) came
across the remains of seven half-columns repeated
seven times,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> and used for the decoration of a façade;
these half-columns were made of semicircular bricks.
There is no trace of capital, base, cornice or any of the
features which columns generally exhibit, they therefore
occupy an early place in the development of columnar
architecture, and Loftus assigns the building in which
they were discovered to the second millennium <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>,&#8212;not
later than 1500<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span> The excavations at Abû Adham, a
mound situated near Tellô, revealed a building with
brick columns exactly like those found by Peters at Nippur,
while at Abû Shahrein (Eridu) Taylor discovered the
remains of a column<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> consisting, in contradistinction to
those mentioned above, of &#8220;slabs of sandstone twenty
inches square and four inches thick, which disposed in a
circular form, and joined together by lime, formed the
chief material; between each layer were cylindrical pieces
of marble, and the whole had a thick coating of lime; successive
layers of which, mixed with small stone and pebbles,
were laid on till it had attained the desired size and
thickness. Its base was shaped like a bowl, and rested
upon a layer of sun-dried bricks, under which again was
fine sand.&#8221; No doubt the column was used in Babylonia
more frequently than might be inferred from the paucity
of the cases in which the excavations have actually produced
tangible evidence of its employment, and the fact
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 164</span>that Nebuchadnezzar represented columns with great
voluted capitals on coloured tiles in the &#7730;asr shows that
they must have been a comparatively familiar architectural
feature in his day, in spite of the fact that, as
Koldewey points out, their pictorial representation on
coloured tiles was probably an artistic substitute for the
real things, for which there was apparently neither place
nor use, as in every place where one might expect them,
simple doors are found; two column-shafts consisting
in palm-trunks, sunk into the ground and surrounded
at the foot, by a circular brick walling strengthened with
asphalt and lime, were however actually found in one of
the courts, but Koldewey assigns the restored building
of which they form a part to the Persian period. In the
Amran<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> mound at Babylon Koldewey discovered the
truncated remains of twenty-two brick columns, which
evidently formed part of a columned building, but the
date of this building seems to be uncertain.</p>

<p>It is here however that the bas-reliefs come to our aid;
in Pl. <a href="#pXIVa">XIV</a> we have a reproduction of the famous Sun-god
Tablet which was made by Nabû-aplu-iddina, king
of Babylonia in the first half of the ninth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, in
which there is a shrine, the roof of which is supported by
a column in the form of a palm-trunk which was probably
overlaid with plates of metal, for plain unadorned wood
would hardly be suitable for the shrine of Shamash, and
moreover the capital and base, both of which are much
the same, could only have assumed this form in metal, the
one material that would easily adapt itself to such motifs.
Similarly the curved back wall and roof were probably
made of metal, for wood of the kind procurable in Babylonia
would not readily bend in this manner. But this
notwithstanding, the column always appears to have
occupied a subordinate position in Babylonian architecture.</p>

<p>Such also appears to have been the case in Assyria:
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 165</span>there too the excavations have done little in the way of
recovering the actual columns used by the Assyrian
monarchs, and for our knowledge of the general form
and appearance of Assyrian columns we are in the main
dependent on the information afforded us by the wall bas-reliefs.
Another source of great fruitfulness would be
the series of ivories found in the north-west palace of
Nimrûd (Calah), but as these are the work of either
Egyptian or Ph&#339;nician artists, the columns therein represented
can hardly be regarded as illustrations of Assyrian
columns.</p>

<p>Of remains of actual columns, the best-preserved is
probably that discovered by Victor Place at Khorsabad;
it comprises the capital and a portion of the shaft (cf.
Fig. <a href="#fig13">13</a>, <i>a</i>) both in one piece; it is made of limestone,
and the surviving fragment is some forty inches high.
The decoration of the capital proper is a variety of the
volute, a device which probably originated in a more or
less accurate imitation of the horns of the goat, and which
is a characteristic feature of Babylonian and Assyrian
decoration.</p>

<p>Sometimes columns represented on the bas-reliefs are
actually surmounted by goats (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>, G) but more
often, the horn-shaped volutes (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>, F) are the only
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 166</span>artistic elements borrowed by the Assyrians from the
animal world, in the formation of their column capitals.
A variety of the same design is seen on the four circular
limestone pedestals discovered by Layard at Nineveh<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
(cf. Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>, A) which doubtless at one time supported
wooden pillars; the diameter of these bases
varied from eleven and a half inches in the narrowest
to two feet seven inches in the broadest part.</p>

<p><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 167</span></p>

<p>Sometimes the backs of lions (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>, E),
sphinxes or other composite monsters formed the bases
of columns, and two such bases in the form of winged
sphinxes were found by Layard in the south-west palace
at Nimrûd, but they were in such a state of decay that
they crumbled soon after excavation, though not before
Layard was able to take a sketch of one of them (cf.
Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>, B).</p>

<p>An interesting example of a capital of a column is the
small stone capital preserved in the British Museum
(cf. Fig. <a href="#fig13">13</a>, <i>b</i>). It probably formed the upper part of one
of the diminutive columns adorning a balustrade, and
doubtless when complete was a more or less faithful
miniature replica of the full-sized capital discovered by
Place (Fig. <a href="#fig13">13</a>, <i>a</i>).</p>

<p>Until recently, owing to the fact that the columns
portrayed on Assyrian bas-reliefs, and also the scant
remains of actual columns which had been recovered,
yielded no examples of shafts other than round,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> or possibly
square (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>, C) it was thought that polygonal-shafted
columns were unknown, but the German
excavations at Ashur have brought to light a capital of
a column made of black basalt,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> together with a portion
of the shaft which is sixteen-sided, and probably belongs
to about the time of Tiglath-Pileser I (1100<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>).</p>

<p>This column at one time bore an inscription, but
unfortunately it is worn away. The remains of another
polygonal-shaped basalt column<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> was discovered on the
same site. It is eight-sided, and bears an inscription of
Shamhsi-Adad, the son of Tiglath-Pileser I.</p>

<p>Two interesting column-bases made of limestone were
also discovered at Ashur,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> under the brick-pavement
of a late Assyrian dwelling-house. One of these consists
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 168</span>in a plinth, a torus and a thin over-plate, all made
in one piece, while in the other case a part of the shaft
is preserved with the torus.</p>

<p>Judging from the bas-reliefs the corner columns of a
building were generally more massive than those which
were intermediate (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>, C, D), a circumstance
which added not only to the stability of the building
itself, but also to the elegance of its appearance. But in
both Babylonia and Assyria the column was used more
often as an adornment to the façades of buildings than as
an actual support for the structure itself. As we have so
little positive evidence of the use of stone columns in
Mesopotamia, it seems probable that as a rule columns
were made of wood or bricks, the disappearance of
almost all trace of which would be adequately accounted
for by the natural destructibility of such materials,
though the disappearance of stone columns, for such
were clearly used, at all events sometimes, might be
readily explained on the supposition that they had been
subsequently used as rollers or for some other purpose.</p>

<h3>THE ARCH</h3>

<p>It has been truly said that the arch was first invented
by people whose building materials were of a small size,
and however open to objection this generalization may
be, it is certainly true in the case of Babylonian architecture,
and also in a somewhat lesser degree in that of
the later Assyrian architecture. Strabo informs us that
&#8220;all the houses in Babylonia were vaulted&#8221;&#8212;&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8053;&#957; &#7936;&#958;&#965;&#955;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#8212;&#8220;because
of the dearth of wood,&#8221; XVI, 1, 5&#8212;but
however reliable or unreliable his statement may
be, the dearth of wood and stone in the alluvial plain
of Lower Mesopotamia of necessity taxed the inventive
powers of the Babylonian architect to the utmost, when
he was confronted with the problem of roofing the buildings
he had erected, and the various rooms which they
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 169</span>were destined to contain. But his genius seems to have
arisen to the occasion, and evolved the principle of the
arch as the best, and indeed the only means of coping
with an otherwise insurmountable difficulty, for the
construction of flat roofs depended on the existence
of slabs of stones or timber-beams, alike large in size
and durable, but both stone and wood of the kind
wanted were not to be found in Babylonia, and the
architect would clearly be unable to fetch wood or stone
from the distant mountains for the purpose of roofing
the chambers of an ordinary house. His inventive
faculties were thus stimulated by the urgency of the
case, and the result produced by these combined factors
is to be seen in the early appearance of the arch, crude
indeed as regards its structure, but none the less involving
the same principles upon which all arches are
built.</p>

<p>The early arches in the tomb-passages in Egypt are
supposed to owe their origin to the removal of the lower
part of the buttress-walls erected to keep the side walls
of the passages from collapsing: such buttress-walls
would of course fulfil their function in preventing the
side walls from falling in, but they would frustrate their
own ends by completely blocking the passage, thus rendering
it perfectly useless. Accordingly the lower portion
of the buttress-wall was removed, the upper part
being allowed to remain, and forming in fact a rudimentary
arch, and it is possible that the Babylonian
arch owes its origin to like fortuitous circumstances. It
is perhaps more probable, however, that the origin of
the arch-shaped structure, if not the discovery of the
principle of the arch, is to be traced to the peculiar
form assumed by the native reed-huts, which doubtless
bore a close resemblance to those commonly used in
the Euphrates valley to-day. This view is advocated by
Heuzey, and is the one which Hilprecht is disposed to
favour.</p>

<p>Most of the ancient buildings of Babylonia have succumbed
to the concurrent ravages of time and climate,
and have consequently bequeathed to us very little
material for the study of Babylonian architecture; the
roofs of buildings, and of the chambers comprised therein,
have long since ceased to be, and we can thus only
theorize as to the general mode of roofing adopted, but
the drains and aqueducts constructed beneath the buildings
have luckily survived to tell their tale, and we owe
our knowledge of the early existence of the arch in
Babylonia chiefly to these comparatively insignificant
remains.</p>

<p>One of the most ancient arches as yet discovered is
that which was brought to light during the course of the
excavations carried on by Peters, Harper, Haynes and
Hilprecht at the ancient city of Nippur (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig15">15</a>).
It was found at a great depth below the surface of the
mound, being more than twenty-two and a half feet below
the pavement of Ur-Engur (<i>circ.</i> 2400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), and fourteen
feet below that of Narâm-Sin (<i>circ.</i> 2700 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>); it is a true
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 171</span>keystone arch pointed in shape, made of well-burnt
plano-convex bricks, and measuring a little over two feet
in height and having a span of about one foot eight
inches, while its length is about three feet, but it seems
probable that originally the tunnel was vaulted throughout.
The irregularity of its construction somewhat
diminishes the significance that it would otherwise have,
but it is of supreme interest as testifying to the fact
that the principle of the arch was known at this very
remote period, however crude the embodiment of that
principle may happen to be. The plano-convex bricks
composing this arch measure 12 × 6 × 2-1/2 inches and bear
the impress of finger-marks on their convex side, a
characteristic feature of pre-Sargonic bricks at Nippur,
Tellô and elsewhere, while the clay from which the bricks
are made is of a light yellow colour. The tunnel itself
seems to have been &#8220;a protecting structure for a drain,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
rather than a drain itself, for below the pavement two
terra-cotta pipes were discovered, the existence of which
can only be explained on this hypothesis. At the top
of the arch were found the remains of another terra-cotta
pipe, the object of which must have been to drain
off the percolating rain-water, and thus prevent it penetrating
through and disintegrating the vaulted structure
below. The T-shaped centre-piece, which was similarly
made of plano-convex bricks, doubtless served the purpose
of keeping the sides of the arch from falling in.
Haynes further informs us that in one of the private
houses at Nippur which had been occupied at least three
times, the earliest of the three doorways traceable in the
ruins, consisted in a segmental arch.</p>

<p>Another very early arch was discovered by M. De
Sarzec at Tellô, close to the building of Ur-Ninâ (cf.
Fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>), having much the same shape as the Nippur
arch illustrated in Fig. <a href="#fig15">15</a> and doubtless used for a
similar purpose, while vaulted passages of which the arch
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 172</span>was semicircular, were discovered by Taylor<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> in his excavations
at Mu&#7731;eyyer (Ur), as early as 1855.</p>

<p>Again the German excavations at Fâra (Shuruppak)
in 1902 and 1903 revealed a number of circular rooms,
each of which was roofed by means of an arch formed
by overlapping bricks placed horizontally, somewhat
after the fashion of the later corbelled arch at Nippur
seen in Fig. <a href="#fig17">17</a>, to which Hilprecht assigns a provisional
date of 2500<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span> We know that the dome was invented
in Babylonia at a very early date, thanks to Dr. Banks&#8217;
discovery at Bismâya of an oval-shaped room in the
vicinity of the temple, the lower parts of the domed
roof of which were found still in place. Its antiquity
is attested by the date of the temple itself which would
appear to have belonged to the pre-Sargonic period, as
the ziggurat was faced with the plano-convex bricks
characteristic of that period, and the pottery furnace, not
far distant, was composed of bricks of the same kind.</p>

<p>In later times the arch was doubtless used more frequently
in Babylonia. A good example of a late Babylonian
arch was discovered by the German excavators
on the &#7730;asr at Babylon; the arch in question (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig18">18</a>)
which is Roman in character, forms the roofing of a
lofty gate cut in the fortification wall. Koldewey<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> is of
opinion that the wall in which this arched gate occurs,
is a good deal older than the Nebuchadnezzar period.</p>

<p>But Assyria, the more or less faithful imitator of
Babylonia in all matters great or small, is also known
to have employed the arch as an architectural device,
though, as in Babylonia, most of the Assyrian arches
which the excavations have brought to light are connected
with the drainage system with which all the
principal buildings were provided. The best examples
of an Assyrian arch of ordinary dimensions are those
found at Khorsabad, the gateways of which town were
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 173</span>roofed with semicircular vaults. One of these gateways
was pulled down by Place in order to make a close examination
of its construction. The height from the pavement
to the top of the arch was found to be twenty-four
and a half feet, the width being a little over fourteen feet.
The arch was made of crude bricks, all of which were
of the same size, and had the same shape, the bricks
being cemented together with soft clay. The vault itself
had long since become disintegrated, but the materials
of which it was made were discovered in the
ruins. Of the brilliantly painted friezes which adorned
these rounded openings (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXX">XXX</a>), something will
be said in the chapter on Painting.</p>

<p>But in regard to the study of what may be called the
arch-principle, the subterranean channels which formed
part of the system of drainage employed by the Assyrians
are of greater importance. These aqueducts are found in
all the palaces, both at Nimrûd and Kouyunjik, but Khorsabad
furnished the best preserved examples, and therefore
afforded the most valuable material for the careful
examination of this architectural contrivance. At
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 174</span>Khorsabad, Place discovered several arched drains of
different shapes, some of them being round, others
elliptical, while others again were pointed, but apparently
in every case the stones or bricks were set at an
angle, so that each course had the support of the course
preceding it, and thus the pressure on the centre of
the arch was reduced to the minimum. In the case of
the pointed arched aqueducts found by Place, the arches
in question are no true keystone arches, indeed they
have no keystones of any kind as will be seen in Figs. <a href="#fig19">19</a>,
<a href="#fig20">20</a>; this arched drain measures four feet eight inches
from the ground to the centre of the vault, its width is
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 175</span>about three feet nine inches, while its original length is
unfortunately not known, though Place succeeded in
tracing it for some two hundred and twenty feet. The
floor was made of large slabs of limestone set in asphalt,
while the ends of the stone-slabs extended beyond
the walls of the vault on either side. The rounded
type of arch is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>; it is semicircular in
shape and is formed of three voussoirs on each side,
which together with the key, thus make seven in all,
but owing to some miscalculation, the keystone appears
to have been too small, in consequence of which there
was a gap between it and the top voussoir on the right,
which was filled in by means of a stone wedge which
can be seen in the figure. Its width and height vary
at different points, in some places it is said to be wide
enough for two men to walk abreast in it.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> The floor
was composed of slabs of limestone which were laid in
asphalt just like the floor of the pointed arch described
above. An elliptical-shaped arch, also found at Khorsabad,
is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#fig22">22</a>: it is formed of eight
voussoirs and a keystone, the gap on either side of
which is filled in by means of two stone wedges. The
failure to make the keystones sufficiently large, and the
consequent necessity for these supplementary wedges
may be due to the architects not having allowed for the
shrinkage of the bricks.</p>

<p>In regard to the arched structures at Nimrûd (Calah)
Layard says he found a vaulted room and more than
one arch. He tells us that &#8220;the arch was constructed
upon the well-known principle of vaulted roofs, the
bricks being placed sideways, one against the other, and
having been probably sustained by a framework until
the vault was completed.&#8221; Knowledge of the principle
of dome-shaped roofs in Assyria as well as in the mother-country,
is evidenced both by the discovery of rooms
whose dimensions would have rendered any other mode
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 176</span>of roofing impossible, and also by the representations
on Assyrian bas-reliefs, as we have already seen.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>The arch-principle is further embodied in some of
the Babylonian and Assyrian graves, and as there is no
other opportunity of discussing the burial-places of the
Babylonians and Assyrians in this volume, it may be permissible
to give here a brief and general description of
one or two of the best preserved of these burial-vaults.
At Mu&#7731;eyyer (Ur) Taylor found a number of arched
vaults (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig24">24</a>) which in most cases measured about
5 feet in height, and 3 feet 7 inches in breadth, while they
were about 7 feet long at the bottom and 5 feet long at
the top. The arch is formed by successive layers of overlapping
bricks. It is interesting to compare the burial
vaults discovered by Andrae at &#7730;alat Sher&#7731;at (Ashur),
one of the best preserved of which is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig23">23</a>.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
This vault was discovered about 16 feet below the level
of the floor of a Parthian door in the neighbourhood,
and over 13 feet below a later Assyrian pavement. At
the time of its construction the vault would appear to
have been about 9 feet beneath the surface of the soil.
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 177</span>The perpendicular walls forming the sides of the lower
part of the tomb are set upon a brick pavement, the
bricks being about 10-1/2 inches square and nearly 2-1/2
inches thick. The height of these perpendicular walls
is approximately 30-1/2 inches and the layers of bricks
which each contains number 13. The vault itself, which
of course commences where the perpendicular walls
cease, is more or less oval in shape, has a span of 5 feet
2 inches, and is 2 feet 11 inches high, the total height
of the tomb from the floor to the top of the arch thus
being nearly 5-1/2 feet. The arch, upon the construction
of which much care had evidently been bestowed, was
formed of forty-six courses of quasi-wedge-shaped
bricks, each resembling a truncated segment of a circle.
The interstices between the courses were filled in with
stones, broken pieces of clay and clay mortar. The outside
of the vault was coated with clay, but the inside
was left plain. The walls at either end incline inwards,
while they are built separately from the arch and are also
rather higher. Access to the tomb from outside is
gained by a slanting and somewhat winding entrance-shaft
built close to the western wall, in which there is a
small arched opening. The threshold of this opening,
which was filled in with loosely laid bricks, lies 23-1/2
inches above the floor of the tomb. In the eastern wall
the usual recess was found, the floor of which was some
35 inches above the floor of the burial chamber. This
recess was about 19 inches in height and 13 inches in
breadth, while the depth of the recess was greater than
that of the wall, and it was therefore necessary to build
another wall on the outside to close it up. In the recess
of another double grave found by Andrae on the
same site, a clay lamp was found, but this was not the
case here; possibly there was at one time a lamp in
the recess of this tomb, its disappearance being due to
the disintegration to which the long infiltration of damp
subjects all articles of unburnt clay. The entrance-shaft
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 178</span>was 39 inches square, while its bottom was level with
the threshold of the small opening in the western wall;
4 feet 2 inches above this floor was a second floor made
of gypsum blocks which were supported by the walls of
the shaft. The interstices between these blocks were
filled in with stones and pieces of clay, while the upper
part of the shaft (i.e. the part above these blocks), the
walls of which had only half the thickness of the walls
below, was similarly filled in right up to the surface
level. The uppermost part of the shaft had been disturbed
by a later building. In the vault, Andrae found
three skeletons, one of which apparently belonged to a
man, and the other two to women. The arms of these
skeletons were at right angles to the bodies, and the
legs were contracted and apart, while the man lies on
his right side and the two women on their left. Traces
of a decayed whitish material were found in the tomb,
which Andrae believes to be the remains of grave-clothes.
Bone needles and pottery had also been deposited
with the corpses. The most interesting articles
of pottery were three wide-necked bottles, two of which
were decorated with dark horizontal lines, while the
neck of the third was adorned with white painting on a
dark ground, a technique well known in early Assyrian
times. What were the contents of the vessels we do
not know; rams&#8217; bones were found near the door as
well as elsewhere, and without doubt these vessels once
contained meat offerings and drink offerings for the
dead. There was evidence for at least three different
periods of occupation in the strata above the grave, two
of which belonged to the Assyrian era and one to the
Parthian times.</p>

<p>The vaulted graves at Ashur do not however all
belong to the same time; some of them may be assigned
to the early Assyrian period, while others were built at
a later date. One of these later brick burial-vaults was
excavated and carefully examined by Andrae in the
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 179</span>spring of 1909.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> The construction of this vault apparently
involved the demolishment of an earlier Assyrian
building. The bricks of which the vault was composed
in some cases bore the inscription of Tukulti-Ninib I,
but in spite of this fact, the grave itself was not built
till a later date. Access to the vault was gained by means
of an entrance-shaft the lower end of which was connected
by means of a passage with the door of the
burial-chamber. A few inches above the ruined débris
of the entrance-shaft the remains of a Parthian building
were discovered. The passage was entirely destroyed,
though the shape of the displaced bricks led
to the conclusion that it was roofed by a barrel-vault.
The arched door into the grave-room which measures
nearly 4 feet in height and has a span of about 22-1/2
inches is composed of very small bricks 6-1/2 × 2-1/8 inches.
It is built into one of the small walls of the grave-room,
and the threshold is made of bricks like its other parts.</p>

<p>The bricks composing the barrel-vaulted roof of the
grave-room are 11-3/4 inches square and 2-3/8 inches thick.
At the other end of the burial-chamber is a small arched
door leading into another room, also barrel-vaulted.
This latter room which measures nearly 5 feet in length,
and 35-1/2 inches in breadth, is built with less care and
regularity than the main burial-chamber. The side-walls
of the annexed room are 5-1/8 inches thick, but the
thickness of the back wall is only 2 inches. The threshold
of the entrance-door to the main burial-chamber
is 20-3/4 inches lower than the pavement of the entrance-shaft,
and nearly 19 inches above the floor of the burial-chamber.
Asphalt and plaster were both used extensively
in the interior.</p>

<p>North-east of the entrance-door, there was a lamp-niche,
3 feet 11-1/4 inches above the floor, and measuring
12-1/2 × 13-3/4 inches in size, and 12-1/2 inches in depth. In
this niche, three terra-cotta pots were discovered, and
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 180</span>Andrae thinks that these pots were probably used as
lamps. The burial-chamber contained two bath-shaped
sarcophagi, one of which measured 6 feet 7-1/2 inches
in length, 28 inches in breadth and 18-1/8 inches in height,
while the other was just over 6 feet 6 inches long, 31
inches wide, and 17 inches deep. The lids of both
these sarcophagi were slightly arched and were tightly
cemented. The top end of one of the covers bore the
rough outline of two flowers.</p>

<p>Upon the brick floor of the annex was the extended
skeleton of a man, while in one of the sarcophagi four
skulls and three skeletons were found. Two of the
skeletons belonged to men, but the third and best-preserved
was that of a woman, while the skeleton to
which the fourth skull belonged was not found. The
funeral furniture was of the ordinary type and consisted
chiefly in terra-cotta dishes and vases, copper
bangles and glass beads.</p>

<h3>BAS-RELIEFS</h3>

<p>The bas-relief was the favourite, and undoubtedly the
most successful expression of the artistic genius of both
Babylonians and Assyrians from the earliest to the latest
times. Their first efforts in this direction were crude
indeed, but this is a fault incidental to the beginnings of
any art. One of the most ancient bas-reliefs yielded by
Babylonian excavations is reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, A. We
have here a representation of a man apparently engaged
in some act of worship, or in the performance of some
unknown ceremony. His large, almond-shaped eyes are
portrayed full face, his aquiline nose stands forth in an
altogether aggressive fashion, his long hair hangs down
his back, while a fillet surrounds his head, from which
two long feathers emanate; these feathers sometimes
adorn the heads of Asiatic princes represented on early
Egyptian monuments. His otherwise nude bust is to
some extent relieved by the presence of a somewhat
lengthy beard, and his clothing consists in the characteristically
Sumerian square shawl arranged skirt-wise.
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 183</span>With his left hand he grasps one of the three sacred poles
before which he stands: the poles are surmounted by
a knob, more or less identical in shape with the early
Babylonian mace-heads. The inscription, written in
very archaic line characters, which still preserve in part,
traces of their pictorial origin, contains a list of offerings
and also a mention of the god Nin-girsu and of his
temple E-ninnû. This most ancient sculpture was
found by De Sarzec on the site of the earliest buildings
at Tellô. It is made of white limestone and is about
seven inches in height.</p>

<p>Two of the fragments of another very archaic bas-relief
found in the same neighbourhood are seen in Figs.
<a href="#fig25">25</a>, B, C. In all the faces portrayed in these two fragments
we observe the same prominent nose, and the
same large, lozenge-shaped eyes already alluded to, but
in other respects they differ from the type illustrated in
Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, A. The most striking and probably the most
consequential individual in the present group occupies
the left end of Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, B. His importance is evidenced
by the excessive length of his long hair, and by
the hooked sceptre which he carries on his shoulder, probably
in token of his royal attributes. In his left hand
he holds what appears to be a fillet, which he is presenting
to the trusty warrior who stands before him, lance
in hand. On the other fragment (Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, C) we have two
other types represented, one characterized by the luxuriancy
of his hair and the profusion of his beard, the other
being distinguished by the complete absence of hair from
both the head and face. In both cases they are clad after
the same fashion, their one and only garment consisting
in a short skirt, the lower portion of which is represented
in a most archaic fashion by a series of tongue-shaped
strips, and the upper portions of which are inscribed
in archaic line characters, while their hands are
clasped across their breast in an attitude of submissive
if not subservient obedience. The why and the wherefore
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 184</span>of the absence of hair from the head and face of one
of these figures is of course unknown, but M. Heuzey
suggests with some plausibility that the figure is thus
represented in virtue of his sacerdotal character. Both
of these fragments once formed part of a round socket
which probably served to support a votive stave or
weapon; they are made of hard limestone, and were
found amid the débris of a building belonging to the
time before Ur-Ninâ.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, F, we have a reproduction of an early limestone
votive tablet from Nippur,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> in the upper register
of which a naked and clean-shaven worshipper is offering
a libation to a seated and bearded god, the whole
being represented in duplicate. Below, a goat and a
sheep are followed by two men, one of whom bears a
vessel on his head and the other holds a stick in his right
hand, while both are clad in the ordinary Sumerian skirt.
Another interesting votive-tablet (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, E) from
Nippur shows us a similar scene&#8212;a naked worshipper
standing before a seated god is offering a libation, the
god being reversed on the left, but the unique interest
attaching to this fragment is in the ploughing-scene
represented below; we see a man ploughing with a
horned animal, probably a gazelle or an antelope, which
appears to indicate that this archaic fragment dates from
a period when neither the ox nor the ass were used as
beasts of labour, while a third<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> bas-relief (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, D),
also religious in character and emanating from the same
site shows a seated goddess accompanied by a bird, while
a burning altar, and a lighted candlestick stand before
her. She holds a pointed cup in her right hand and behind
her we see a long-bearded priest leading a clean-shaven
worshipper who carries a goat in his right arm,
into the presence of the goddess.</p>

<p>The extraordinary popularity of what may be termed
the bas-relief mode of sculpture among the Sumerians
is strikingly illustrated by its employment in the decoration
of mace-heads and other objects; in Fig. <a href="#fig26">26</a>, B we
have a large mace-head made of hard white limestone,
seven and a half inches in height, and having a diameter
of little over six inches. The scheme of decoration
takes the form of a procession of lions, six in number,
all following in the same direction, and each burying
his teeth in the back of the lion going before. The
bodies of the lions are portrayed side-wise, but the colossal-eyed
heads are seen full face. These lions are, despite
their crudeness, already surprisingly true to life; the
top of the mace-head (A) is not left unadorned, but has
been made good use of by the sculptor who has carved
the heraldic lion-headed eagle of Lagash upon its smooth
surface. It bears an inscription of Mesilim, king of
Kish, who is known from another inscription to have
flourished and ruled over the country some time before
the foundation of the first dynasty of Lagash by Ur-Ninâ,
in the neighbourhood of whose building this mace-head
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 186</span>
was actually found, though at a slightly lower
level.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Portion of the Vulture-Stele of Eannatum, Patesi of Lagash</span></p></div>

<p>We now come to the time of Ur-Ninâ, the most
interesting of whose monuments, at least from the
pictorial point of view, is the sculpture reproduced in
Fig. <a href="#fig26">26</a>. This relief, which is divided into two registers,
introduces us to Ur-Ninâ, his family and his
courtiers. The king himself is of colossal size, indicative
doubtless of his colossal power; in the upper register
he is portrayed standing, his left hand on his nude bust
as in the lower register, while with his right hand he is
balancing a basket, which, as M. Heuzey has pointed
out, probably contains the clay and foundation brick for
the temple of Nin-girsu, rather than offerings for the god.
This view is further supported by the inscription written
alongside the figure of the basket carrier, the first
line of which contains a mention of the temple of Nin-girsu.
Ur-Ninâ is thus represented as the servant of
his god, and the honour attaching to the menial task
in which he is engaged may be judged by the fact that
he alone is apparently accounted worthy, his sons and
followers merely standing by, their hands clasped in a
reverential attitude. Below, the king is seen in a more
comfortable and homely pose, though here too he would
seem to be attending to his religious duties; he is raising
his cup either to drink to the honour of the gods,
or else to offer a libation, but in either case the task must
have been less arduous and possibly more pleasant than
that which occupies him in the upper register. With
one exception all the heads and faces are devoid of hair,
and all are clad in the Sumerian short woollen skirt,
though the king&#8217;s skirt is more flounced than those of
his courtiers, as becomes royalty. The type of vesture
met with here, as well as on the Vulture Stele and on
so many of the early Sumerian sculptures, was called
&#8220;Kaunakes.&#8221; The figure immediately in front of the
standing king in the upper register is distinguished from
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 187</span>the others not only by being taller, and wearing a skirt
resembling the king&#8217;s garment, but also by having long
hair. Opinion differs as to whether we are to see in this
figure the daughter of the king, or whether, on the contrary,
we have here a portrait of the king&#8217;s eldest son,
as both Heuzey and Radau think, and in support of their
view, the improbability of assigning such a leading part
to a woman at this period has been aptly urged; the
dress differs from that of Ur-Ninâ in being suspended
over the left shoulder, and in this respect recalls Eannatum&#8217;s
mantle on the Vulture Stele (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXII">XII</a>). The
round or square hole in the centre of many of these
early plaques was without doubt destined to serve as a
socket for some votive stave or weapon, and the plaques
pierced with such holes must accordingly have been laid
in a horizontal and not in a vertical position. Ur-Ninâ
was succeeded by Akurgal, who in turn gave place to
Eannatum, whose famous Stele of Victory we now come
to consider.</p>

<p>This monument was unfortunately not found intact
and complete, but six fragments, some small, others comparatively
large, but all full of interest, were unearthed at
Tellô by M. de Sarzec. The scenes depicted and the
events portrayed on the surviving fragments of this renowned
stele, are instructive both from a religious as
well as from a historical point of view. In Pl. <a href="#pXII">XII</a> we
have a reproduction of perhaps the most interesting of
these fragments. The scene here is divided into two
registers, in both of which the troops of Eannatum are
seen engaged on active service. The king leads the vanguard
in person and on foot; above his head the title
&#8220;Conqueror for the god Nin-girsu&#8221; is inscribed. His
apparel consists in the &#8220;kaunakes&#8221; skirt, to which allusion
has already been made, while over it is a mantle suspended
over the left shoulder and passing under the
right arm. His head is protected by a helmet, pointed at
the top like those of his warriors, but differing from
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 188</span>theirs in being furnished with ear-pieces; his long hair
for the most part hangs down his back, some of it however
is gathered up and bound by a fillet at the back of
his head. In his right hand he holds what purports to be
a species of boomerang.</p>

<p>His troops are drawn up in a wedge-shaped formation,
and if this representation is intentional, it is a surprising
testimony to the skill in military tactics to which the
Sumerians had attained at this extremely early date, but
it may on the other hand be merely due to ignorance of
perspective on the part of the artist. Their offensive
weapons consist of lances some six or eight feet in length,
while for defence they hold large rectangular shields
which cover the whole of their bodies from neck to ankle.
Were there any doubt as to the fortunes of this army
of Eannatum, it would be immediately dispelled by a
glance at the feet of the troops engaged, who are ruthlessly
trampling on the prostrate bodies of their vanquished
foes.</p>

<p>Below we have another battle-scene: the king again
leads his troops to action, but here he is mounted in his
chariot, his dress is identical with that worn by him in
the upper half of this relief, and in his right hand he
grasps a boomerang similar to the one with which he is
armed above, but in his left hand he poises a long stave,
the end of which is unfortunately not visible owing to
the poor preservation of this part of the sculpture, but
without doubt the point of this formidable weapon was
once in immediate contact with the shaven head of a
conquered enemy, while before him there is a quiver
packed with arrows.</p>

<p><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 189</span></p>

<p>His followers in this instance are armed with a long
lance and a battle-axe, but are protected by no shields,
though their heads are covered with the same conical-shaped
helmets, and they are clad in the familiar &#8220;kaunakes&#8221;
skirts. Perhaps we are to see in these troops a detachment
of the king&#8217;s personal bodyguard. What <a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 190</span>strikes one at once about this sculpture is the extraordinary
disparity between the crudeness of the art on the
one hand, and the elaborate equipment and arrangement
of Eannatum&#8217;s army on the other, from which it is clear
that the energy of the Sumerians at this time was spent
in the battle-field rather than in the pursuit of the peaceful
arts.</p>

<p>Another fragment of this remarkable sculpture is
reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig27">27</a>, A. We have here a veritable
heap of corpses piled on top of each other. They are
entirely naked, and their heads are shaven in apparent
contradistinction to the troops of Eannatum. The bodies
are extended and are arranged so that the head of each
lies in contiguity with the feet of his next door neighbour;
two figures clad in short archaically-fringed skirts
are ascending this heap by means of a rope; the free
hand of each is engaged in balancing a basket on the
head which may contain offerings for the fallen, but
more probably earth wherewith to bury their corpses.
It is a matter of dispute as to whether these superimposed
corpses represent the fallen warriors of Eannatum&#8217;s
army, or the smitten foes of Lagash; but the
fact that the bodies are naked, and the further fact that
in none of the Babylonian or Assyrian battle-scenes is
there a single example of a warrior of the victor&#8217;s army
being represented as killed, and lastly the improbability
of the artist having accentuated the losses of Eannatum
in such a conspicuous manner, and especially upon a
stele of victory, all militate against the former and for
the latter view. In that case we have a striking testimony
to the clemency exhibited by the Sumerians of the
earliest times, the enemy being apparently allowed sometimes
the privilege of burying their dead.</p>

<p>In Figure <a href="#fig27">27</a> B we have another fragment of this
unique specimen of Sumerian art. The representative
of Lagash is here portrayed on a colossal scale; his head
has a profusion of hair, and from his face hangs a long
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 191</span>streaked beard similar to that worn by Gilgamesh on the
cylinder-seals. Possibly, as Heuzey suggests, this figure
is a representation of that hero of Babylonian folk-lore,
but it is probably a picture of the god Nin-girsu himself.
In any case, it can hardly be Eannatum, as the latter is
on this same stele portrayed clean shaven. This colossal
figure grasps in his left hand the heraldic arms of Lagash,
while in his right hand he holds a round-headed
mace similar to that seen in other early bas-reliefs.
Before him lie a number of prisoners confined in a net or
a cage (cf. Hab. I. 15); one of these unhappy victims has
thrust his head through the meshes of his prison with a
view to evading the next blow, but this laudable attempt
does not seem to have met with the success which it
deserved, for the head of the mace is seen in immediate
contact with that of the individual in question. All the
figures here portrayed, whether belonging to Eannatum&#8217;s
army, or to that of the enemy, exhibit the same
type of face, the most distinguishing characteristics of
which are the large almond-shaped eyes and the aquiline
nose. The stele is known as the &#8220;Vulture Stele&#8221; and
derives its name from another fragment on which are
portrayed a number of vultures making off with the
heads, and sharply severed limbs of the slain. Eannatum,
whose victories are here depicted, was succeeded
by Enannatum, and after him Entemena, the nephew
of Eannatum ascended the throne. Unfortunately the
artistic relics of his time are few in number, but those
that have survived are peculiarly interesting. In a subsequent
chapter (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>) we shall devote some space to
an examination of the silver vase of this ancient ruler,
but here (cf. Fig <a href="#fig27">27</a>, C) we have a specimen of the sculpture
of his reign.</p>

<p>This little sculptured block, which is made of a mixture
of clay and bitumen, and in appearance resembles
black stone, was found in the neighbourhood of a building
composed of bricks bearing the name of Entemena.
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 192</span>In the upper register we see the heraldic device of
the city of Lagash&#8212;a lion-headed eagle grasping two
lions facing in opposite directions, doubtless indicative
of the power exercised by Lagash over the peoples
of Sumer and Akkad. We have already seen it on the
Vulture Stele, and it occurs also on the yet earlier
monuments of Ur-Ninâ, but a comparison of the royal
arms as here represented with the device on the Vulture
Stele (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig27">27</a>, B) shows a marked advancement from
the artistic point of view. The eagle is still sufficiently
stereotyped, and the extraordinary amount of detail with
which the artist has treated his subject has had the undesirable
effect of making it even more formal than it
would otherwise be, but the lions are much more animated
and vigorous in conception than in the earlier
sculptures. Instead of walking along in an impassive,
lifeless manner, they literally writhe under the grip of
their victorious foe, whose wings they seek to gnaw
with their teeth. Below, we have a representation of
a crouching calf or heifer, one of whose front legs is
raised as though about to leap up. As Heuzey says,
the pose of this animal is wonderfully natural, and must
have been studied from nature; it at once recalls the
procession of animals engraved on the silver vase of
Entemena (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>). No doubt the animal here
portrayed is a sacrificial victim. To the right of the
central hole found so frequently in these early sculptures,
stands the worshipper, of gigantic size, holding a staff
in his left hand. He is clean shaven, and is nude down
to the waist, from which hangs the usual kaunakes
skirt. The lower part of this little block is decorated
with the scroll design so frequently encountered on
cylinder-seals. The size of its reproduction here however
is entirely out of proportion to the rest of the
sculpture, and it may therefore in this case represent a
skein of wool as another form of offering. The mention
of the priest Dudu, whose name also occurs on the
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 193</span>silver vase of Entemena, removes any uncertainty there
might be as to the period to which we should assign
this little block, though a judgment based on an examination
of the style of art here exhibited would have
independently placed it in the same category as the silver
vase of Entemena. The line-characters in which the
inscription is written are more developed than those
found on the monuments of Ur-Ninâ and Eannatum,
many of them already betraying the wedge-shaped formation
characteristic of the writing called &#8220;cuneiform.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Stele of Victory of Narâm-Sin</span></p>

<p>Sufficient perhaps has been said to give a general idea
of the artistic merits or demerits of the old Sumerian
bas-reliefs of the first dynasty of Lagash. The next
Babylonian school of art which specifically compels both
attention and admiration is that to which the era of the
kings of Akkad or Agade gave birth. From some points
of view Mesopotamian art reached her climax at this
period; neither before nor after was the same success
in the reproduction of human figures attained, and the
sculptures belonging to this period are in some ways
unique in the history of oriental art. The most famous
of these monuments of Babylonian genius is reproduced
in Pl. <a href="#pXIII">XIII</a>. This stele, which was found at Susa in the
course of M. G. de Morgan&#8217;s epoch-making excavations
on that site, was fashioned to commemorate some notable
victory achieved by Narâm-Sin of Agade. The
king is seen in the act of ascending a high mountain;
behind him march his trusty warriors armed with spears
or lances, and apparently carrying standards. The king
himself is armed with a bow and arrow, and also a battle-axe,
while his head is protected by a horned helmet;
before him crouches one of the enemy, into whose neck
an arrow has sunk deep, while another grasps the broken
end of a spear. The figure of the king is full of vitality
and animation, and offers a very striking contrast to the
lifeless conventionalism characteristic of the older Babylonian
and the later Assyrian representations of human
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 194</span>beings. The whole scene is alive with action, and the
effect is not marred by any undue disproportion between
the figure of the king and those of his followers. Above
the king&#8217;s head are the remains of an inscription by
Narâm-Sin, but upon the cone intended to represent
the mountain which the king is scaling, is an inscription
occupying seven lines and bearing the name of
Shutruk-Nakhkhunte, king of Elam, which seems to
indicate that the stele had been captured by the Elamites
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 195</span>and carried off to Susa as a trophy. An interesting
basalt bas-relief of this same king was discovered near
Diarbekr (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig28">28</a> &#8220;A&#8221;). Narâm-Sin is standing on
the right of the inscription, clad in a kind of plaid and
wearing a conical hat. His beard is long and pointed,
while bracelets encircle his wrists, and he carries a short
staff in each hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig28" id="fig28" />

<p>The remains (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig28">28</a> &#8220;B,&#8221; &#8220;C&#8221;) of another very
interesting stele belonging to about the same epoch or
a little earlier, and military in character, were discovered
by De Sarzec at Tellô. In the top register of fragment
&#8220;B&#8221; three warriors are seen proceeding in file, two of
whom are archers and carry quivers which are decorated
with large leaves, while a leg is all that remains of the
third. In the second register an archer is seen in the act
of drawing his bow; his attitude is fixed and steady,
and his bow is bent to the utmost, while his quiver
hangs over his shoulder; before him a smitten foe lies
prostrate on his back, and in contradistinction to his vanquisher
who is clad in a long tunic, is entirely naked,
while his right hand is raised in supplication. We next
come to another warrior clad in a short fringed skirt
and wearing a conical helmet: with his left hand he is
seizing the beard of an enemy, who is also naked like
his prostrate brother in the same register, and his right
hand is raised, about to bring down his knotted club
upon the face of his defeated prisoner. Below, is the
figure of another warrior armed with a long pike. In
&#8220;C&#8221; we have another fragment of this interesting sculpture,
in the top register of which two warriors are seen
marching in file; the one behind is carrying a battle-axe
at the trail. In the register below, a warrior clad in
a short skirt and wearing a helmet is engaged with a
prostrate enemy; one of his feet is firmly planted in
the unfortunate man&#8217;s stomach, and with his right hand
he is further punishing him with the aid of his knotted
club. Behind these two figures we have another like
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 196</span>scene represented; here the all-powerful warrior is
armed with a long lance, which he is carrying at the
port; with his right arm he is marching along a prisoner
much shorter than himself, whose arms are bound behind
his back; the prisoner is naked, like most of the
defeated enemies of Sumer and Akkad as portrayed by
the sculptor. All that remains of the third register is the
head and the upper part of the bow of an archer.</p>

<p>Apart from the spirit which animates these little figures,
the chief point of interest in connection with them
lies in the general scheme of artistic representation here
adopted. No longer is the conquering army portrayed
<i>en masse</i> as on the Vulture Stele of Eannatum, but the
idea conveyed and the event commemorated are precisely
the same in either case. The all-prevailing idea
is that of victory, only the picture of a phalanx of armed
troops trampling the nude bodies of their foes beneath
their feet, has given place to a series of selected incidents
of individual combat, represented after the Homeric
fashion. This sculpture clearly belongs to the same
school as Narâm-Sin&#8217;s stele of Victory, which, however,
it probably somewhat antedates, as the cuneiform signs
found on the second fragment are of a more archaic character
than those used on the monuments of Shar-Gâni-sharri
and Narâm-Sin. The little that remains of the
inscription is of considerable interest as it contains a
mention of the city of Agade, the centre of the Semitic
Empire established by the two last-named kings.</p>

<p>We must now pass from the epoch of the Semitic kings
of Agade or Akkad, to the later period of Sumerian civilization,
the age in which Ur-Engur and Dungi, kings
of Ur, and Ur-Bau and Gudea, rulers of Lagash, lived
and reigned. We are unable to assign a definite date to
any of these rulers, but they probably flourished somewhere
about the middle of the third millennium <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
One of the most interesting bas-reliefs belonging to this
time is reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig28">28</a>, &#8220;D.&#8221; We have here a
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 197</span>representation of a god seated on a throne. He wears
a long square beard, and his head is surmounted by the
horned cap emblematic of divinity; his mantle covers
nearly the whole of his body, the right arm alone being
excepted. The head, which in its contour and general
appearance recalls the heads of the Assyrian winged
human-headed lions and bulls of some fifteen or sixteen
centuries later (cf. Plate <a href="#pXXV">XXV</a>), is like them, depicted
full face, the seated body being sculptured in
profile; in his left hand the god holds a sceptre, the
end of which is fashioned like a leaf. In Fig. <a href="#fig28">28</a>, &#8220;E,&#8221;
we have a reproduction of what is probably the largest
fragment of an early Babylonian bas-relief in existence.
It was excavated at Tellô and measures about four feet
in length. The upper part of the relief is occupied
with a procession of four figures apparently engaged in
the service of the gods, while below, a seated figure is
seen playing an elaborate instrument of eleven strings,
the lower part of the frame of which is decorated with
a horned head and the figure of a bull. This relief would
appear to have formed part of a stone socket.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the material used for most of
the Babylonian as well as the later Assyrian bas-reliefs
was a species of limestone and alabaster, as this kind of
stone lends itself readily to the impress of the chisel, but
the harder stones were also sometimes utilized for the
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> Thus in Fig. <a href="#fig28">28</a>, F, we have a sketch of what remains
of a black steatite relief belonging to this period.
The fragmentary inscription gives us the name of the
goddess Ningal, who is here portrayed in a singularly
attractive manner, and with an extraordinary amount of
detail. An elaborate robe covers the whole of her body,
and a necklace adorns her throat; her hair hangs over
her shoulders, while the crown of her head is encircled
by a fillet. The general technique of this little sculpture
is surprising in its fidelity to nature; the attitude of the
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 198</span>goddess, her body half turned and her left arm resting
negligently on the back of her chair is life-like, and the
face itself is not without a beauty of its own. The difficulty
involved in the portrayal of a human eye in profile,
so painfully manifest on the Vulture Stele and other
earlier Sumerian monuments, where the eye is portrayed
full-face, the rest of the head being done in profile, has
here been surmounted, and we have before us a perfectly
naturally conceived and executed face and head.</p>

<p>Some few centuries after the time of Gudea the city
of Babylon became the centre of the chief power in
Southern Mesopotamia. Unfortunately the excavations
have not yielded us a rich harvest for the study of the
artistic development of sculpture during this period, but
the material at hand would tend to show that there was
far less development in the interval between the later
dynasty of Lagash, the age in which Gudea lived, and
the establishment of the first Semitic dynasty of the city

</table>

<p>In Pl. <a href="#pXIVa">XIV</a> we have a reproduction of the sculptured
stele of black basalt upon which is inscribed the world-renowned
legal code of Khammurabi, the most illustrious
king of this first dynasty of Babylon. The king
is seen standing in reverential attitude before the Sun-god
Shamash, from whom he is receiving the laws inscribed
below. The king wears a long robe reaching
down to his ankles, but leaving his right arm, which
is raised in adoration, untrammelled by the folds of his
mantle. The seated deity likewise has a long beard, but
his high horned cap differentiates him at once from his
adoring servant, while from his shoulders tongues of
fire are seen shooting forth, doubtless representing the
rays of the sun. In his right hand he holds the ring and
staff emblematic of dominion and power. He is similarly
represented in Nabû-aplu-iddina&#8217;s tablet (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXIVa">XIV</a>)
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 199</span>and also on two contemporaneous stelæ in the Louvre,
in one of which he is in a standing position. Beneath
his feet are the mountains portrayed in miniature. The
laws enacted on this stele, which is now one of the treasures
of the Louvre, number about two hundred and
eighty, and deal with all kinds of subjects. It was set
up in E-sagila, the temple of the chief god Marduk in
Babylon, so that every aggrieved party at law could go
and consult it. Like so many of the monuments of Babylonian
antiquity, this stele was captured by the Elamites
and removed to Susa, where it remained until the French
excavations on that site brought it once more to light.</p>

<p>As we have already seen<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> the dynasty to which Khammurabi
belonged was brought to an end some time later
by an invasion of the Hittites, a powerful mountainous
people whose home lay in Cappadocia. A century or so
afterwards, i.e. about 1800 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, another mountainous
nation known as the Kassites swept down from their
strongholds in the Elamite territory on the east of the
Tigris into the defenceless Babylonian plain, where they
established and maintained their supremacy for a long
time to come. Unfortunately the artistic relics of the
Kassite period are few, and for the most part unimportant.
Meanwhile, however, the Assyrians in the north
had asserted their independence, and ultimately (i.e.
about 1275 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) succeeded in reducing Babylonia and
establishing their sway over the whole of Mesopotamia.
In spite of this fact, we have practically no specimen of
the sculptor&#8217;s art during the long interval separating the
fall of the First Dynasty of Babylon and the ninth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and it is not till the time of Ashur-nasir-pal,
king of Assyria, and Nabû-aplu-iddina, king of Babylon,
that we are able again to study in detail the work of the
sculptor in the Tigro-Euphratian valley. To the former
king we are indebted for a large series of bas-reliefs
taken from the walls of his palace at Nimrûd (Calah),
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 200</span>while to the latter we owe one of the most interesting
and instructive Babylonian bas-reliefs in existence (cf.
Pl. <a href="#pXIVa">XIV</a>).</p>

<p>One of the earliest specimens of Assyrian bas-relief
as yet discovered is that which was found by Taylor at
a village called Korkhar, situated some fifty miles north
of Diarbekr. The relief in question was sculptured on
the natural rock, which had been smoothed for the purpose
by order of Tiglath-Pileser I (<i>circ.</i> 1100 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>).<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
The king is represented in a standing posture, his right
arm is extended and he is pointing with his forefinger,
while in his left hand he holds a mace; the king&#8217;s figure
and general appearance are already quite stereotyped,
and show no more originality or vigour than the representations
of the later Assyrian kings. This same
monarch has further left us the upper part of an obelisk
erected to commemorate his feats in the chase, on one
side of which there is a small relief in which Tiglath-Pileser
is seen receiving the submission of various
vassal-chiefs, while above their heads are the emblems
of certain deities, the most interesting of which is the
winged human-headed disc of Ashur, the patron god
of Assyria. But these reliefs, interesting as they are,
afford us little material upon which to form an estimate
of the sculptural ability of the Assyrians at this
period; the chief inference which they permit us to
draw is that Assyrian art seems to have neither advanced
nor declined appreciably, during the interval
of two hundred or more years which lapsed between
the time of Tiglath-Pileser and Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal. The
latter king succeeded his father Tukulti-Ninib II as
king of Assyria (885 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>). Tukulti-Ninib had largely
restored the fallen fortunes of the northern country,
thus paving the way for the successes of future reigns,
but Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal extended the power of Assyria in
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 201</span>every direction, as well as consolidating her rule over
the districts reduced by his father. It is accordingly by
no means unnatural that he should have desired to commemorate
and perpetuate the record of his triumphs in
pictorial fashion upon the walls of his palace at Nimrûd,
and it is with his reign that the history of Assyrian bas-reliefs
really commences, so far as our present material
goes.</p>

<p>Assyria was in some ways the natural home of the bas-relief,
for she contained a plentiful supply of alabaster
and limestone, the softness of which facilitated the
work of the artist and reduced his difficulties to a
minimum: Babylonia on the other hand yielded practically
no stone, and all that was used had to be
quarried at a distance and transported at great cost and
labour, and that fact makes the early efforts of the
Babylonians in this direction all the more praise-worthy,
and the proficiency to which those efforts gave
birth, as seen for example in Narâm-Sin&#8217;s stele of
Victory, the more astonishing. But this notwithstanding,
the bas-relief was more highly developed in the
northern country, where it played an all-important part
in the artistic life of the people. The general object
of these bas-reliefs was to commemorate the king&#8217;s
victories over his enemies and his conquests in the
chase, rather than to produce a purely æsthetic effect.
In other words they are pictorial records rather than
artistic products, and that fact is further borne witness
to by the cuneiform texts with which they are generally
inscribed. At the same time however, they afford
material for the study of Assyrian sculpture. The art
of sculpture in Assyria suffered all the drawbacks which
befall every art once it becomes professionalized; it lacks
spontaneity which is the very connotation of art, it is
made to order, and therefore it inevitably knows no
freedom but is the dull slave of conventionalism. But
in spite of all this, the bas-reliefs of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 202</span>and his successors, hampered as they are by those
universal enemies of human art, professionalism and
conventionalism, still enshrine, or imprison if you will,
the artistic genius of the people, and on this account,
if for no other, are deserving of careful attention.</p>

<p>The reliefs which covered the walls of the palace of
Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal at Nimrûd (Calah) consist either of single
figures of gigantic size, or else in a series of small scenes
divided into two friezes by cuneiform inscriptions. In
Pl. <a href="#pXV">XV</a> we see Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal followed by a winged
mythological being; both are engaged in the performance
of a religious ceremony, the king with the
bow and the arrow which he holds in his hands, the attendant
with the cone which he holds up in his right
hand. The semi-divine character of the winged creature
is evidenced by his head-gear which consists of
the horned cap, but the faces of both figures are more
or less identical, a lamentable characteristic of all Assyrian
portrayals of human or semi-humanly conceived
beings. The chief peculiarities of this type of face are
the large eyes, the curved nose, and the profusion of
hair on both head and face. Both figures are clad in a
long robe and deeply fringed mantle which extend to
the feet. The footwear consists of sandals fastened by
thongs passing over the instep and round the big toe.
The muscular arms of both are adorned with bracelets,
the pattern of the decoration on which is a replica of
the ubiquitous rosette so characteristic of Assyrian art.
The king&#8217;s head-gear consists of a helmet from which
two tails hang, and in its appearance generally, is not
unlike a bishop&#8217;s mitre. Both king and divine attendant
carry what appear to be two daggers tucked into
their waistbands. The muscularity noticeable in the
arms is yet more aggressive in the left leg of the mythological
being, which, unlike that of the king, is left exposed.
This grotesquely realized conception of strength
is but the decadent descendant of the naturally
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 203</span>expressed vigour so noticeable in the statues of Gudea.
And here may be mentioned one characteristic peculiarity
of Assyrian sculpture; it will be observed that a long
cuneiform inscription is chiselled right across the relief,
pursuing the even or uneven tenor of its way quite
recklessly through wings, garments, bodies and hands,
and there is no obstacle which it fails to overcome, not
even excepting the deep fringe on the mantles.</p>

<p>The subjects of the smaller reliefs of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal
are many and various, though they all revolve round
one of two themes, the battle-field or the chase. In
one, Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal has alighted from his chariot and
is receiving the submission of the enemy; in another
we see a number of fugitives swimming to a fortress on
inflated skins. Here we see tributary chiefs bringing
offerings to lay them at the feet of their imperious lord,
while further on we see the bowmen of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal
mounted in their chariots and discharging arrows
against the enemy. In one relief the king himself is seen
erect in his chariot with his bow fully drawn; elsewhere
Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal is represented in the act of crossing a
river; the king has not however dismounted from his
chariot, but is being rowed over, chariot and all.</p>

<p>One of the most luminous of these small bas-reliefs is
reproduced in Pl. <a href="#pXVI">XVI(2)</a>. Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal and his army
are storming a beleaguered city; the walls of the city
are crenelated after the regular Mesopotamian fashion.
Immediately before the walls the movable tower resting
on six small wheels and containing the battering ram is
stationed, the efficacy of which may be judged from
the bricks falling from the battered walls. Mounted
on the top of the tower is an archer with bow bent,
whose person is protected by another warrior bearing
a shield. The king is portrayed behind the movable
tower in the act of drawing his bow; his head-gear
differs from that of the warriors, who wear a conical
helmet. In Pl. <a href="#pXVI">XVI(3)</a>, we see the warriors of Ashur-na&#7779;irpal
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 204</span>returning victorious from the battle-field. On the
right of the picture are two three-horse chariots, both
of which carry standard-bearers; above them we see a
vulture making off with his prey, which in this instance
consists in a human head, and in front are the infantry who
appear to be gloating over the gory heads of their smitten
adversaries, while to add to the ghastliness of the scene
two musicians are playing on stringed instruments.</p>

<p>Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal was however quite as proud of his
victories in the chase as he was of his conquests in the
battle-field, as is attested by the numerous hunting scenes
which he caused to be carved in relief on his palace walls.
In Pl. <a href="#pXVI">XVI(4)</a> we see Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal, erect in his chariot,
in the act of dispatching a lion by the aid of his bow and
arrow. The lion is treated with considerable boldness,
and the skill of the artist in the portrayal of animal life&#8212;or
death, as here&#8212;when compared with the stereotyped
lifelessness of the king, is sufficiently striking.
But Assyrian art does not reach its climax here, as we
shall see when we come to consider the lions on Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s
bas-reliefs; the latter show a certain delicacy
in the handling, and an intuition into all those infinite
subtleties and varying nuances which are the hall-mark
of life, animal or human as the case may be, and which
apparently are not felt or at all events not successfully
realized in the earlier works. The portrayal of the lion
here is strong and life-like, but the spectator can never
get away from the consciousness of the fact that it is a pictorial
representation; he can never abandon the thought
of the sculptor and the excellence of his art, or lose himself,
be it only for a moment, in the reality itself. But
in the reliefs of Ashur-bani-pal, one can for a brief space
forget the artist and his work, and see the lion itself;
one can catch a faint note of his dying gasp as he lies
there motionless, his body transfixed with arrows, and
it is in the effacement of the artist and the material which
he uses that art attains the zenith of her power.</p>

<p>But Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal&#8217;s love for sport did not deter
him from his religious obligations, on the contrary he
appears to have attributed his triumphs in the chase to
his god, for on his return he offers a libation over the
body of the lion or bull which providence has delivered
into his hand (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXVI">XVI</a>(1)). The cup he holds in his
hand resembles the top of a champagne glass, while his
left hand is leaning on a bow in the usual characteristic
manner. Before him is an officer, evidently of high
rank, for his dress is an exact replica of the king&#8217;s, but
his head is bare and his hands are clasped in a deferential
manner. By the side of this high official is an
attendant or eunuch with a fly-flap, while behind him
is another attendant, and last of all are two musicians
playing stringed instruments. On the other side of
the picture, immediately behind the king is an attendant
with a ceremonial umbrella, followed by two servants
with bows on their shoulders.</p>

<p>Although Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal&#8217;s contemporary Nabû-aplu-iddina
king of Babylon has left us but few memorials
of his reign, we are nevertheless indebted to
him for one unique specimen of Mesopotamian sculpture
(cf. Pl. <a href="#pXIVa">XIV</a>). Reference has already been made
to this tablet on account of the light which it throws
on certain architectural problems, it now remains for
us to consider it as a work of art and an historical
monument. The text records the restoration of the
temple of Shamash by two kings called Simmash-shipak
and Eulmash-shakin-shum, both of whose
reigns took place some time in the eleventh century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> It then proceeds to describe the condition into
which the temple, its ornaments and accessories subsequently
fell; the shrine of the god had been denuded
of its treasures which had been misappropriated in one
way or another; the sculptures which adorned the
walls and the image of the deity himself had suffered
violence at the hands of the godless. All this Nabûaplu-iddina
<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 206</span>set about to rectify; he restored the glory
which the fane had enjoyed in early days, in particular
he enriched the time-honoured statue of the god with
gold and lapis lazuli, he re-established the temple worship
in all its former pomp and splendour, and took
vengeance upon the enemies of Shamash and the king
who had perpetrated this sacrilegious outrage. The king
himself celebrated the occasion of the temple&#8217;s re-dedication
by a munificent supply of offerings, and issued detailed
regulations as to the ceremonial vestments of the
priests, and the days upon which in each case they were
to be worn in future. In the scene above, Shamash
is portrayed enthroned in his shrine at Sippar, holding
a disc and rod in his right hand; the sides of the throne
are sculptured with mythological beings, whose rôle
seems to be to support the throne, while above and in
front of the god&#8217;s head are three astrological emblems.
The roof and supporting pillar of the shrine itself have
been discussed elsewhere (cf. p. <a href="#Page_164">164</a>): two divine beings
are stationed on the top of the shrine; they hold in
their hands two taut ropes which are attached to a large
disc, emblematic of the sun, placed on an altar immediately
in front of the shrine, and by means of which the
disc is kept in position. Approaching the altar and advancing
towards the shrine are seen three worshippers,
the first of whom is the high-priest of Shamash, who
is introducing the king into the presence of the divine
symbol in a manner so frequently seen on Babylonian
cylinder-seals, while last of all comes a goddess. One of
the interesting points about this little sculptured tablet
is that though it was made by a ninth century king of
Babylon the style of art to which it conforms would
indicate that it is not an original work of Nabû-aplu-iddina,
but a copy of a much older archetype. The head-dress
of the god for example is characterized by four tiers
of horns, and is practically identical with that found even
as early as the time of Gudea, the later Assyrian divine
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 207</span>head-dress on the other hand generally having but two
or three horns on either side: Shamash here too holds
the disc and rod in his hand in precisely the same manner
as he is represented doing on the famous stele of
Khammurabi (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXIVa">XIV</a>); his long beard is likewise
depicted in much the same way as it is there. In short,
there seems little doubt that the original of this ninth
century product must be sought for somewhere about the
commencement of the second millennium <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> Another
particularly interesting feature about the discovery of
this sculpture was the simultaneous discovery of two
clay coverings for it. One of these was found to be
broken, and was probably made by Nabû-aplu-iddina
himself, but the other bears an inscription of Nabopolassar,
king of Babylon from 625-604 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> During the
two centuries which had elapsed between the time of
Nabû-aplu-iddina and the reign of Nabopolassar, the
oft-restored temple had again fallen into disrepair, and
it fell to the lot of the last-named king to once more restore
the time-honoured fane; he too, like his predecessor
two hundred years before, made &#8220;offerings rich
and rare&#8221; to the immortal Shamash. The object of these
clay coverings was of course to preserve the sculpture
from damage (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig5">5</a>).</p>

<p>To return to Assyria, Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal was succeeded
by his son Shalmaneser II: we unfortunately possess
but few bas-reliefs belonging to the time of this king,
the best-known being those sculptured on the Black
Obelisk; these reliefs have been illustrated and dealt
with in detail in so many works, owing chiefly to the
historic importance of the inscription on this monument,
that it seems hardly necessary nor desirable to
discuss them here. Shalmaneser&#8217;s immediate successors
have left us few memorials of themselves, artistic or
otherwise, and after their reigns a general decadence
seems to have set in, from which Assyria did not recover
till the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III, or Pul as he
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 208</span>is called in 2 Kings xv. 19 and elsewhere. This king
restored the fortunes of the empire, and extended his
power on every side, and happily for our subject he has
immortalized his exploits in picture-fashion on hard
stone, as well as in writing on clay cylinders and tablets,
though unfortunately the bas-reliefs of this king which
have survived are few in number. One of the best
preserved is that in which Tiglath-Pileser III is seen
conducting a siege (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXVII">XVII</a>). The details of this
sculpture vividly recall the words Isaiah is reported to
have used in his endeavour to rally the failing courage
of Hezekiah, king of Judah, who was inclined to surrender
himself and his city to Sennacherib&#8212;&#8220;Thus
saith the Lord concerning the King of Assyria, he shall
not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor
come before it with shields nor cast a bank against it.&#8221;
All the means of attack here mentioned are represented
in our bas-relief. The warriors have their bows bent,
and doubtless have already dispatched many an arrow
with deadly effect: their persons are protected by large
wicker shields which cover the whole of their bodies.
The &#8220;bank&#8221; in this case has clearly been &#8220;cast against&#8221;
the besieged city, and the purpose that the &#8220;bank&#8221; was
destined to serve is at once manifest. It consisted in
an artificial mound up which the movable tower containing
the battering-ram was advanced. On the top
of the wall of the besieged city, a man is seen with
hands outstretched suing for mercy. The defeat of the
enemy and the reduction of their city is signalized in
a highly realistic fashion; beneath the &#8220;bank&#8221; some of
the vanquished are seen prostrate and naked, while
above, on a level with the top of the wall a number of
captives, also naked, are impaled on stakes. The inscription
refers to the various articles of tribute brought
by conquered peoples, but is not possessed of any
especial interest.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>&#8212;Bas-relief from Khorsabad. (After Botta.)</p></div>

<p>Tiglath-Pileser III was succeeded by Shalmaneser IV,
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210" /><span class="pagenum">Pg 210</span>the most noteworthy event of whose reign was the siege
of Samaria; the city held out two years, and fell in
722<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>, after Shalmaneser had been dethroned by Sargon
the usurper. Sargon reigned some eighteen years
and achieved many victories, the most momentous of
which was that gained over the united Egyptians and
Philistines at Raphia, near the Egyptian frontier. His
sculptural bequests are many, and they comprise the
gigantic winged human-headed bulls and lions which
are in some ways the most impressive and the most
characteristic specimens of oriental art. These winged
monsters are neither bas-reliefs, nor are they perfect
round sculptures, but a mixture of the two, and will
accordingly receive consideration in the second half of
this chapter.</p>

<p>But the palace erected by Sargon at Khorsabad, which
was excavated by Botta more than half a century ago
has yielded a rich harvest of bas-reliefs pure and simple,
one of which is reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig29">29</a>. The scene is a
familiar one in Assyrian sculpture; a fortress is being
attacked, of course successfully, by Assyrian soldiers.
The fortress appears to have been built on the top of
a height, doubtless with a view to rendering it the more
impregnable. It consists of three rows of towers, superimposed
one on the top of the other, the largest row
being at the base and the smallest at the top, the general
contour not being unlike that of a ziggurat with its receding
stages. One wing of the fortress is protected
by two towers, with which it is connected by means of a
wall, while the other wing apparently extends right down
the slope of the height. Access to the fortress is gained
by arched doorways, one of the many incidental proofs
of the frequency with which the arch was used in Assyrian
architecture. A number of small rectangular houses lie
at the foot of the hill, the doorways of which are arched
like those of the flanking towers, while in both cases
the doors or gates themselves are double-leaved. The
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 211</span>windows, or embrasures, which are very numerous,
are all square, and the battlements are crenelated as
usual. Three pairs of colossal horns crown the fortress,
which Botta is inclined to think may be actual horns,
the disproportion of their size being of course no argument
against that view, for disproportion is a characteristic
of early oriental art. In such case they could be
only emblematic, and presumably indicative of strength,
but it seems infinitely more probable that the horns represent
the sculptor&#8217;s attempt to portray flames of fire,
which are thus seen leaping up from the fired fortress.
Some of the besieged are suing for mercy with outstretched
hands, while others are evidently determined
to fight to the last: they are armed with long spears and
rectangular shields, while their backs are covered with
the skins of animals. The enemy are literally at the
gate, and it is impossible to tell when they will effect an
entrance. Three of them are attempting to undermine
the wall by means of long-handled prongs, two more
are at work with their short swords, while to the left
are two Assyrian spearmen of superhuman size, whose
symbolic presence at once removes even the faintest
shadow of doubt there might be as to the issue of the
conflict. The attack is a strenuous one, as a mere walkover
would bring no glory to the Assyrian arms, but at
the same time, in spite of the severity of the battle
raging round the fortress, the irresistible might of the
Assyrian colossus is grimly suggested by the two giant
warriors. The artistic treatment of the two heroes deserves
some notice; the aggressive muscularity so
characteristic of Assyrian representations of kings and
warriors is not indeed altogether wanting in the legs,
but the arms are wholly free from this all but universal
defect, while the pose of both arms and legs is exceptionally
natural and singularly true to life. They are
armed with spears of the same type as those used by
the beleaguered army, but their shields are round in contradistinction
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 212</span>to the oblong shields of the enemy, and
they are girded with short swords. Their clothing and
helmets are of a frequently recurring type, while both of
them wear armlets and one of them wears a plain bracelet
on his left wrist.</p>

<p>Sargon was succeeded in 705<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span> by his famous son
Sennacherib, the principal event of whose reign was probably
the destruction of Babylon in 689<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span> But the
name of Sennacherib is famous rather on account of his
close relations with the kingdom of Judah, and the unsuccessful
siege of Jerusalem during the reign of Hezekiah,
than for the conquests which he made, considerable
as they were. The excavation of his palace at
Nineveh has led to the discovery of a large number of
bas-reliefs, many of which had been fractured as well
as damaged by fire when the city was sacked by the combined
forces of the Medes and the Babylonians about
609<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span> For the most part they illustrate the campaigns
undertaken by Sennacherib. What is noticeable
at once in the bas-reliefs of this king is their complexity,
as contrasted with the simplicity of those of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal.
We have already observed that entire scenes are
sometimes portrayed upon the bas-reliefs of the last-named
monarch, though more often the relief is monopolized
by two or three large and striking figures, one
of which generally represents the king, but by Sennacherib&#8217;s
time what had hitherto been the exception now
becomes the rule, and the bas-reliefs of this king are
practically all scenic in their effect and most elaborate
in their composition. This exaggerated complexity is
due not so much to the variety of subjects treated in each
relief, as to the ignorance of perspective on the part of
the artist, for the treatment of even a limited number
of subjects or objects within the scope of a single picture
demands that these objects be seen and represented in
perspective, and if that demand is not met, confusion
worse confounded is the inevitable result of the artist&#8217;s
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 213</span>abortive attempt. This confusion is seen to perfection,
if the &#8220;<i>oxymoron</i>&#8221; may be allowed, in the reliefs which
adorned the palace walls of Sennacherib king of Assyria.
A portion of one of the most instructive of these sculptured
slabs is reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>&#8212;Bas-relief of Sennacherib. (After Layard.)</p></div>

<p>The scene is one of great interest, not merely for the
student of Assyrian art, but for the light which it throws
upon the mechanical resources of which the Assyrians
of that day availed themselves, resources which the very
existence of the gigantic human-headed bulls and lions
presupposes, but which are here illustrated in a specific
manner by Sennacherib&#8217;s sculptors. The safe transport
of a gigantic mass of solid stone was no easy matter even
for the excavator of the nineteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> how much
greater the difficulties to be surmounted by a people
whose mechanical knowledge was some two and a half
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 214</span>millennia younger! In the artistic treatment of this sculpture
there are of course obvious defects. There is the
usual ignorance of perspective on the part of the sculptor,
though this is less pronounced than elsewhere; the
trees in the foreground and background are arranged in
lines in a somewhat conventional manner, though the
intentional or accidental diminution of size in the trees
in the background as compared with those in the front
of the sculpture, makes the general setting of the scene
appear much more true in its arrangement than would
otherwise be the case. Unfortunately it has not been
possible to include the back row of trees without sacrificing
the more important parts of the sculpture, hence
their omission here.</p>

<p>All interest is centred round the bull, Assyrians and
war-captives alike having but one work and that is
the transport of this awe-inspiring monster. In the
right-hand corner we see two carts, each being drawn
by two prisoners and containing ropes and timber.
The carts have two wheels, each wheel containing eight
spokes in contradistinction to the four spokes of the
early Babylonian wheels. The bull has been carefully
laid on its side upon a sledge which is shaped
like a boat in the front. Both ends of the sledge
are pierced with round holes for the reception of the
ropes. The latter, tightly secured to the sledge and bull,
are about to be pulled by a number of prisoners who
succeed under the gentle stimulus of the taskmaster&#8217;s
lash in gradually moving the colossal monster. Before
starting, however, it was seemingly necessary to give the
sledge some assistance by means of a huge lever, one end
of which is placed under the stern while to the other end
three ropes are attached, by means of which a number
of workmen are doing their utmost to move the lever
on its fulcrum. To gain a greater leverage one of the
workmen is engaged in inserting a wedge between the
upper surface of the fulcrum and the under side of the
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 215</span>lever, while the movement of the sledge is further facilitated
by means of rollers which workmen are seen busily
putting in position. Upon the top of the recumbent bull
kneels the foreman engineer giving the signal for each
successive and united effort to the men on the towing-ropes.
The presence of three soldiers was apparently
necessary to enforce the admonitions of the foreman&#8212;an
early example of the invocation of the military to support
civil authority. Below in the foreground, a number
of captives are seen carrying rollers to be set down as the
bull advances. They are accompanied by taskmasters who
appear to have been wholly devoid of any sense of mercy.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&#8212;Sennacherib at Lachish. (After Layard.)</p></div>

<p>But the best known, because from certain points of
view the most interesting, bas-relief from Sennacherib&#8217;s
palace at Kouyunjik is that in which Sennacherib is seen
receiving the submission of the conquered inhabitants of
Lachish (Tell el-&#7716;esy) (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>). The king is seated
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 216</span>on a throne of great magnificence, and his feet repose on
a high footstool. The side of the throne is divided into
three registers, each of which is occupied by a row of men
with arms upstretched to support the bar above: the bars
themselves are decorated with various geometrical devices,
while the throne stands upon four large cone-shaped
feet. The king&#8217;s robes are as elaborate as his
throne, both mantle and tunic being richly embroidered
and fringed with tassels, while his head-gear consists in
a kind of mitre, apparently the usual state head-gear of
Assyrian monarchs. Behind him are two attendants, probably
eunuchs, each holding a fly-flap in his right hand
and a bandlet in his left; their dress consists in a long
robe reaching down to the ankle and tied round the waist
with a girdle, while a variegated sash passing from the left
shoulder across the chest relieves the monotony of the
comparatively inornate costume. Their hair is long, and
the ends are curled as in the other figures here represented,
but they are beardless and hatless. Behind these
two attendants is the royal pavilion, the roof-canvas of
which is apparently raised either for ventilation or to
keep off the sun. The king with a bow in his left hand
and an arrow in his right, is listening to his chief officers
who are reporting the incidents of the siege of Lachish.
The personage who leads the procession carries no arms,
but has his head bared and is clad more sumptuously
than the attendant officers, as befitteth the king&#8217;s vizier;
the warriors are armed with maces, short swords, bows
and arrows, or spears as the case may be. At a respectful
distance from the royal throne three representatives of
the conquered inhabitants of the city are making their
obeisance before the king, one of them literally grovelling
on all fours. The prisoners have a thick, though not a
long, crop of hair, while their beards are also thick and
short, in contradistinction to those of the Assyrians.
Their dress consists of a perfectly plain, short-sleeved
tunic reaching from neck to ankle, while their feet are
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 217</span>unshod. The dress of the Assyrian warriors will be considered
in a subsequent chapter (Chap. XIII). The scene
of this somewhat dramatic spectacle is outside the captured
city, under the grateful shade of vines and fig-trees,
while mountains covered with trees form a fitting background
to the picture. The purport of the four-lined
cuneiform inscription in front of the king is that Sennacherib,
king of hosts, king of Assyria, sat upon his
throne of state, and the spoil of the city of Lachish passed
before him. But magnificent as is the throne upon which
Sennacherib is here seated, it must have been far surpassed
in splendour by his royal throne at Nineveh; the latter
was apparently made of rock crystal, some of the fragments
of which are still preserved.</p>

<p>Sennacherib was succeeded after some intestine feuds
by his son Esarhaddon; Esarhaddon carried on the traditions
of his predecessors in warring against Ph&#339;nicia, and
reducing Babylonia, but the distinguishing feature of his
reign was the occupation of Lower Egypt by the Assyrians
in 672<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span> Unfortunately we have very few sculptural
monuments of this king, though it must not be assumed
from this that he was a whit less proud of his feats than his
father, but his reign has practically no interest for the
student of art and affords us little material for the pursuit
of our present subject. This remark, however, is very
far from applying to Ashur-bani-pal, his all-glorious son,
whose triumphs in the field of art were as great in their
way as those achieved in the battle-field. Ashur-bani-pal
came to the throne in 668<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span> and ruled some forty-two
years, during which he raised the power of Assyria to a
point never reached before and never reached again. The
more noteworthy events of Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s reign as
well as the consequential effects of his taste for literature
have been treated of elsewhere; suffice it to say
here that this outburst of military, intellectual and artistic
activity was but the supreme effort of an empire
whose strength was exhausted and whose vitality was
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 218</span>impaired, and even before the death of Ashur-bani-pal
the meteoric splendour of her glory had begun to
pale. It was as it were the final sickness of an aged
man who had weathered many storms and whose recuperative
power had hitherto risen to every occasion, at
last however the final crisis comes and all is over. But
that golden era of Assyrian art, so brief and short-lived,
has nevertheless been immortalized by the artists of that
day in those stone slabs which now form one of the most
precious possessions of the British Museum.</p>

<p>Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s exploits in the hunting field have
been already referred to, and it is these that he chose
to record pictorially upon his palace-walls rather than
his victories on the field of battle, and it is to this choice
that we owe those masterpieces of animal representation,
which otherwise might never have been crystallized into
concrete and permanent results.</p>

<p>A large number of these bas-reliefs are concerned
with lion-hunting; from Pl. <a href="#pXVIII">XVIII</a> it would appear that
lions sometimes suffered themselves to become domesticated;
we here see a lion and lioness, the one standing,
the other lying carelessly stretched at its ease upon the
ground, in a kind of garden, the cultivated character of
which is manifest from the presence of a vine. The lion
stands before the crouching lioness with head and fore-paws
outstretched, in a manner well-illustrative of that
dignity and majesty which is always and has always been
associated with the king of animals. Unfortunately
most of the head and the entire hind-quarters of the lion
are missing, but sufficient remains of the animal for us
to imagine the rest without much risk of our imagination
leading us astray.</p>

<p>But the animals which were the victims of the royal
sport must clearly have been wild; sometimes they
admitted of being hunted in their natural state, but in
Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s time it was evidently necessary to
capture them beforehand and keep them in cages till
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 219</span>required for the hunt. In Pl. <a href="#pXIX">XIX</a> we see one such
captive specimen emerging from his temporary prison
at the instance of the attendant who has pulled up
the wicker gate of the cage. The lion&#8217;s satisfaction
at his release is shown by the alacrity with which he
sallies forth, little conscious of the doom in front of
him. Though the end seems always to have been the
same, the method by which the end was accomplished
varied from time to time. Thus on one occasion the
king is seen thrusting his long-shafted spear into the
lion&#8217;s back, himself securely mounted in his chariot;
at another time he is on foot, and is almost playfully
stabbing the lion in the neck with his dagger, but the
more usual way&#8212;no doubt, because the safest&#8212;of dispatching
big game, and lions in particular, seems to have
been by means of the bow and arrow which could be
brought into play at a respectful distance. In Pl. <a href="#pXIX">XIX</a> we
see a number of lions thus transfixed; their various positions,
some of which are sublimely natural, while others
appear rather imaginative, all speak eloquently and in
moving terms of that common tragedy to which all the
animal world, whether human or bestial must some day
become victims,&#8212;the tragedy of death. One lion is
seen transfixed by four arrows, two of which are deeply
lodged in the lion&#8217;s neck, a third in the centre of the
head, and the last in the middle of the back. The lion
is prostrate, his four legs dragging helplessly behind and
underneath his massive body, while his face bespeaks
the death-agony in which he lies convulsed. Above, on
the left, another animal has been incapacitated, if not
mortally wounded, by two arrow wounds, one in the
neck and the other in the back, while a little lower down
to the right, a lioness smitten through the lungs has
rolled over helplessly on her back. At the bottom of
this unique scene we have another lion transfixed by
some five arrows, most of which are lodged in or
about the animal&#8217;s head; like the lioness he has sunk
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 220</span>over on his back, his limbs being contorted almost beyond
recognition. To the left we have the full hind-quarters
of a lion who is springing up in a frenzy
of rage excited by an arrow-wound in the back. Last
of all in the bottom left-hand corner another lion is
seen in the act of expiring as the result of his wounds.
But whatever end befell the unfortunate lion, he seems
to have been attended with ceremonial rites at the last,
his body was conveyed home by three or four male servants,
and stretched upon the ground, after which the
king himself pours a libation over the silent, motionless
animal, whose grandeur in death is only surpassed by
his energy in life (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXa">XX</a>).</p>

<p>The large majority of the visitors to the Assyrian
Saloon in the British Museum, where these masterpieces
of animal reproduction are arranged, have never
witnessed a lion hunt in real life, but none can go away
without having an ineffaceable impression left on his
mind of the grimness of such a scene, of which the
reality is here so graphically portrayed. Lion-hunting
was doubtless the favourite sport of the Assyrian
kings, but other game also engaged the royal patronage,
notably deer, wild asses and bulls. Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal
has left us a sculpture in which he is represented
hunting wild bulls from his chariot, and in Pl. <a href="#pXXa">XX</a> we
have a bas-relief from Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s palace on which a
wild-ass hunt is seen in full progress. In the upper part
of the scene a wild-ass lies helpless on his back, pierced
by three arrows, while a fourth arrow is on the wing,
though swiftly nearing its appointed goal. To the right
we see another ass rushing away in hot haste before the
double onslaught of dogs and arrows. To the left two
dogs resembling mastiffs are busily engaged in checking
the headlong course of a wild ass whose flight has already
been retarded by the arrow which has pierced his fore-quarters.
Below, a hound of the type already alluded to
is in mad pursuit of a young foal. The foal is preceded
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 221</span>by a full-grown ass who is turning its head solicitously,
possibly in anxiety for its own safety, possibly for that of
the young foal behind. The manner in which this latter
action has been portrayed by the artist is surprising in its
fidelity to nature and its artistic merits. To enable the
reader to form a fair and correct estimate of the genius
of the Assyrians in the art of animal representation it
would be necessary to give reproductions of the whole
series of Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s hunting scenes, but it is hoped
that sufficient has here been shown to demonstrate their
extraordinary ability in this direction.</p>

<p>Not only however are we indebted to Ashur-bani-pal
for the animal masterpieces of Assyrian art, but also for
one of the few scenes which give us a glimpse into the
private and non-official life of the king (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXI">XXI</a>). The
king is reclining on a magnificently carved couch, while
his queen sits bolt upright on a chair immediately opposite;
the chair is as elaborate in its way as the couch, as
is also the stool upon which her feet repose. In spite of
the tropical appearance of the garden in which the feast
is spread, the king is covered with a rug, while the queen
is clad in richly-woven robes which look anything but
cool. A table is set by the side of the couch and in front
of the queen&#8217;s chair, upon which are laid the royal dainties.
Both their majesties are about to quaff the ambrosial
nectar with which their low but capacious cups are
without doubt filled, but the scene of their banquet is in
itself an appetizer: the thick palm trees, the rich clusters
of grapes, and the hovering birds all adding a stimulus
to the royal digestive faculties. Behind the king stand
two attendants with fly-flappers, and another richly
carved table upon which the royal weapons are laid.
The queen is similarly protected by fly-flappers, behind
the bearers of which are other servants laden with
oriental luxuries, while in the distance the musicians are
playing their voluptuous eastern melodies. The instruments
are stringed, as are most of the musical instruments
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 222</span>portrayed on Babylonian and Assyrian bas-reliefs,
though tambourines, double-pipes, cymbals, drums and
trumpets were also apparently known.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> In spite however
of all these intoxicating influences, there remained
one other item in the programme&#8212;an item which doubtless
had the most stimulating effect of all upon the appetite
of the great king, i.e. the head of Te-umman of Elam,
which hangs from a tree in the king&#8217;s immediate line of
vision, and no doubt was a most gratifying spectacle to
his majesty.</p>

<p>With Ashur-bani-pal Assyrian art as well as her literature
reached its climax; with him the limits of the empire
were extended further than ever before; but after
his reign no slow decadence, but a swift collapse set in
which was alike tragic in its significance and momentous
in its consequences. It is however not altogether unfitting,
either in the case of empires, or in that of individuals,
that when the climax is reached, and the highest
possibilities are realized, life should not be prolonged
for retrogressive purposes, and Assyria was in a large
degree saved from this misfortune. The memory of her
greatness and of her wide influence was in no way marred
by a long period of decline, her time was up and her end
came, but the reason was to be found rather in those indomitable
circumstances of fate and external environment
than in a radical and internal demoralization. We
have no reliefs of the Neo-Babylonian period worth recording,
with the exception of the coloured clay reliefs
which we shall consider in the chapter on painting.</p>

<h3>SCULPTURE IN THE ROUND</h3>

<p>For the study of early Sumerian sculpture in the
round, we unfortunately have not much material at
hand. As has been already stated, both the Babylonians
and Assyrians excelled in bas-relief work rather than in
full rounded sculpture, and what they excelled in, that
<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 223</span>they practised most; in spite of this fact however, both
peoples were alive to the superiority of sculpture in the
round, but the difficulties involved in producing work
of this kind prevented such work being undertaken save
for exceptional purposes, hence they never attained a
very high degree of excellence in this department of art.
Of the earlier Sumerian period we have hardly any complete
<span class="figright200" style="width: 200px;"><a name="fig32" id="fig32" />
<img src="images/fig32.jpg" width="200" height="432" alt="Fig. 32." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span> (<i>A. J. S. L.</i>, XXI,
pp. 59, ff.)</span></span>
statues, and the paucity of
such makes those that have survived
the more valuable. One of
the most interesting of these is that
of Esar king of Adab (Bismâya),
which was discovered during the
course of the American excavations
on that site,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> and is now preserved
in the Imperial Ottoman Museum,
Constantinople (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig32">32</a>). It is
made of marble and weighs two
hundred pounds. In height it measures
just under thirty-five inches,
the circumference of the skirt being
close upon thirty-two inches. The
latter is heavily plaited and is a
replica of the garment in which
the Sumerians portrayed on the
earliest monuments are always
clad. The type of face in like
manner attests its great antiquity; the bald head, the
aquiline nose forming a straight line with the forehead,
the triangular eye-sockets which were at one time inlaid
with ivory, all being characteristic features of the most
ancient Sumerian attempts at human portraiture. The
king bears an inscription upon his right shoulder written
in a very archaic and semi-pictorial script, from which
we learn the name of the king, and also of the city over
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 224</span>which he ruled. It was discovered at a great depth below
the surface of the mound, among the ruins of a temple

of the pre-Ur-Ninâ buildings. A particularly interesting

<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>  (<i>Déc. en Chald.</i>,
Pl. I, <i>ter.</i> No. 3.)</span></span>
feature about this unique monument is that
the arms are free from the body, whereas in nearly all
Mesopotamian statues they are joined up to the sides.
The hands are clasped in front as is the case in so many
Sumerian statues and reliefs of all
periods, while the feet are embedded
in the pedestal to enable them
to support the short, thick-set and
heavy body, which was apparently
a peculiarity of the Sumerian physique.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we have hardly
any complete figures of early Sumerian
women, the little stone
statuette in Fig. <a href="#fig33">33</a> gives us however
some idea of the appearance
and dress of women in early Babylonia.
Her features conform to the
usual Sumerian type, while her
long hair is tied with a fillet which
surrounds her head and gathers
up her flowing tresses at the back.</p>

<p>But the three archaic stone heads (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXII">XXII</a>) which
were unearthed at Tellô enable us to form a somewhat
more complete estimate of the artistic ability of the
sculptors of that age in regard to the portrayal of the
human face and head. The head on the right closely
resembles the central one, both of which exhibit a more
advanced style of art than that exhibited in the head on
the left, which is, however, the most interesting of the
three. It was discovered on the other side of the Shatt-el-Hai,
the canal which connects the Tigris with the
Euphrates; unlike the others, the aquiline nose is perfectly
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 225</span>preserved, the eyes are as usual large and shaped
like almonds, and were doubtless at one time inlaid with
shell and coloured, while the lips betray a suppressed
smile; the type of face is exactly the same as that seen
on the Vulture Stele, though the details are of course
more precise, as might be expected from a work in the
round.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig34">34</a>, A, we have an alabaster head of an early
Sumerian woman; the face belongs to the same type as
that to which the male heads in Pl. <a href="#pXXII">XXII</a> conform. The
ears, so prominent in the case of the clean-shaven male
heads, are here entirely concealed by the tresses of hair
which hang in thick horizontally streaked lines about her
forehead, head and neck. The hair is kept in its place
by means of a fillet fastened at the back. The large eye-holes
must have at one time been inlaid, probably with
lapis lazuli in the case of a woman as here. The eyebrows
are sculptures in relief, and not incised as is the
case in other early Sumerian sculptures.</p>

<p><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 226</span></p>

<p>Other early specimens of Babylonian sculpture are to
be found in the various statues of Manishtusu discovered
during the course of the excavations carried on by
the French Mission to Susa, one of which is reproduced
in Fig. <a href="#fig34">34</a>, B. Manishtusu was a Semitic king of Kish
and probably reigned about 2700 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>; the statue here
shown is consequently one of the earliest examples of
Semitic sculpture in the round as yet known, and according
to De Morgan<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> is the most ancient work of art as
yet discovered on the old Persian sites. Even at this
early date we see traces of that Semitic conventionalism
so prevalent in the later Assyrian era. The square face,
the large eyes, the coiffure and the long symmetrically
arranged beard here seen, all being prominent features
in Assyrian representations of kings and potentates.
The pupils of the eyes were black and were fixed in their
sockets by means of bitumen, as was frequently the case
in these early sculptures. The statue is made of alabaster,
and the inscription on the back is written in archaic
line characters.</p>

<p>This age was followed by a period during which the
sculptor&#8217;s art gradually made itself master of the means
at its disposal. This transition period is well illustrated
by an alabaster statuette of a seated woman reproduced
in Fig. <a href="#fig34">34</a>, C. The advance which the configuration of her
face shows on the archaic head in Fig. <a href="#fig34">34</a>, A, is at once
obvious: the stereotyped eyes have become less exaggerated
and more natural, the lips are more womanly,
the nose less obtrusive. Her long hair hangs naturally
and loosely down her back, while a thick fillet encircles
her head. Her long robe covers the whole of her body
from neck to ankle, and she holds in her hands a round-shaped
vase which probably contains a libation for the
gods. This little statuette is just over seven inches high.</p>

<p>But it was not till the middle of the third millennium
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> i.e. the age of Gudea, patesi of Lagash, that sculpture
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 227</span>in the round assumed a prominent part in the artistic life
of the people, and it was not till then that the sculptor
seems to have regularly aspired to reproducing human
figures at quasi-life size, fashioning them at the same
time out of the hardest volcanic rocks. In Pl. <a href="#pXXIII">XXIII</a>, A, B
we have reproductions of two of the decapitated statues
found by De Sarzec at Tellô. Eight of these statues,
some of which are in a standing posture, while others
are seated, bear inscriptions of Gudea, patesi of Lagash;
one of the remaining two being inscribed with the name
of his predecessor, Ur-Bau. The majority of these
statues are under life-size, but the dimensions of one of
them at least considerably exceed those of an ordinary
man. The statue here represented (Pl. <a href="#pXXIII">XXIII</a>, A) is the
most artistically conceived of the series; it possesses both
grace and force, and shows very little trace of the conventionalism
so noticeable in later Assyrian sculptures,
the feet being the only inanimate and truly conventional
part of the production. The arms are strong and sinewy,
but the muscles are perfectly naturally executed, and
contrast very favourably with the exaggerated muscles
of the royal statues of Assyria. The hands are folded in
token of submission to the goddess Nin-harsag, to whom
this statue was seemingly dedicated. Among the epithets
applied to this goddess here, are &#8220;Lady of the Mountains,&#8221;
&#8220;protectress of the town and mother of its inhabitants,&#8221;
and lastly, &#8220;mother of the gods.&#8221; This statue is
made of green diorite and is just over four feet high.</p>

<p>In Pl. <a href="#pXXIII">XXIII</a>, B we have another statue of Gudea, this
time seated. The chief peculiarity about this and its
companion statue, both of which are in the Louvre, lies
in the flat tablet which each of them carries on their
knees. On one of these tablets a regular plan of Gudea&#8217;s
buildings has been engraved, showing various doors,
crenelated towers, and so forth, together with the carpenter&#8217;s
rule and stylus, which are similarly engraved
on the knee-tablet of the statue reproduced here.
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 228</span>The most striking feature in the sculpture itself is
the boldness with which the nude limbs are carved,
and the nervous vitality with which they abound. This
is especially noticeable in the treatment of the right arm
and shoulder, which the arrangement of the mantle
leaves exposed. The cartouche on the shoulder contains
the name and titles of Gudea. The lengthy inscription
below records that this statue has been dedicated to the
goddess Gatumdug, who is styled &#8220;the mother of Shirpurla&#8221;
(= Lagash), it then treats of the various rites
and ceremonies with which the building of the temple
of this goddess was accompanied. This statue, like the
standing one in Pl. <a href="#pXXIII">XXIII</a> A, is made of diorite. Several of
the heads belonging to these statues have been brought
to light, one of which is seen in Pl. <a href="#pXXIII">XXIII</a>, C. The head
which is decked with a variegated turban is again remarkable
for its strength and the boldness with which it is executed;
the eyes are large and wide open, a noticeable
characteristic in all Mesopotamian art, whether early or
late; the eyebrows are heavy, and the chin firm, while the
jaws are thick-set and make the general contour of the face
square. The absence of due proportion in all these early
Babylonian sculptures is at once manifest: they one and
all have a more or less squat appearance, the breadth
being always too great proportionally for the height,
while the head is too large for the body and the latter
is too thin from back to front. But when all the failings
incidental to the products of an inexperienced art are
duly taken into consideration, there is a certain fidelity
to nature, and consequently a degree of life observable
in the crudest of these early Babylonian sculptures which
at once raises them to a higher level than the Assyrian
statues to which they unconsciously gave birth. The
accentuation of the strong lines and curves of the earlier
sculptures in the later products of Assyrian times, has
merely led to exaggeration, and the effect is inevitably
stereotyped and unnatural.</p>

<p>In Pl. <a href="#pXXIII">XXIII</a>, D, however, we have the upper part of a
diorite figure of a woman belonging to about the same
period as Gudea, which has to a great extent lost the
heavy and massive appearance so noticeable in the
statues of the patesi, and possesses both grace and
beauty. The dress will be considered in a subsequent
chapter, and it will be sufficient to here call attention to
the singularly natural manner in which the folds of the
garment are represented. During the interval between
the epoch associated with the name of Gudea and that
rendered illustrious by Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal and the Assyrian
kings, the practice of sculpturing in the round appears
to have fallen largely into desuetude, if we may judge
from the extreme paucity of the material that has come
down to us, and it is not till the time of the Assyrian
Empire that we are able again to make a detailed study
of the sculptor&#8217;s art in Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>One of the earliest examples of Assyrian sculpture
in the round is reproduced in Pl. <a href="#pXXIV">XXIV</a>, B. It is a torso
of a female figure, who bears upon her back an inscription
of Ashur-bel-kala, king of Assyria, whose reign may
be assigned to the first half of the eleventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
It was discovered at Kouyunjik, and is now in the British
Museum. The size is somewhat below that of life; but
in spite of the fact that the proportions are bad, the body
between the legs and arms being too short, this sculpture,
when compared with the generality of Assyrian
attempts to reproduce human beings, is at once striking
for the natural manner in which the artist&#8217;s conception
of feminine beauty is realized, and as such is entirely
unique in the realm of Assyrian sculpture.</p>

<p>The remains of another very early Assyrian sculpture<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
in the round were discovered in the course of the
German excavations at Ashur. Unfortunately the head,
hands and feet of this statue are missing, but the small
part of the head which is preserved, though having an
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 230</span>abundance of hair shows no trace of the elaborate curls
of later days, the beard being represented by a series of
twelve or more corrugated strands, thereby recalling the
Babylonian statues of the Khammurabi period. The
clothing consists of a close-fitting garment made of a
simple fine-textured material, and is decorated with a
fringe.</p>

<p>Of Assyrian royal statues that of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal (cf.
Pl. <a href="#pXXIV">XXIV</a>, C) is the best preserved and the most successful.
It is made of hard limestone, and measures three
feet four inches in height; it was found in a broken
condition along with the limestone pedestal upon which
it once stood, and it now stands upon the same original
pedestal in the Nimrûd Gallery of the British Museum.
The total height of the statue with the pedestal is five
feet eleven and a half inches. Fortunately none of the
fragments of the figure were missing, and consequently
it was possible to restore the statue so perfectly as to
render it one of the finest Assyrian statues in existence.
The king stands there, the very incarnation of impassive
dignity and imperturbable majesty, and it is strange
how impressive the motionless can at times be. It would
perhaps be hardly true to employ such words as &#8220;life&#8221;
or &#8220;animation&#8221; in attempting to describe this sculpture,
but it possesses something even higher than external
vigour and vitality, it has a force, an indescribable
&#8220;reserve of strength,&#8221; which the absence of anything
like aggressive activity only serves to enhance. The king
is clad in long and elaborately made robes which reach
down to his toes. The beard and hair, both of which are
rich and profuse, are curled with much care and precision.
The king holds in his right hand a sickle-shaped
object, which is presumably meant to be a sceptre, while
in his left he holds a mace with a tassel at the lower end.
His left arm is concealed by the fold of his outer mantle,
but the right is bare with the exception of a wrist-bracelet.
The type of face bears all the acknowledged
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 231</span>Assyrian characteristics; large, wide-open eyes, a curved
nose, and the wealth of hair to which we have just referred.
The proportions are fairly accurate, though the
depth or thickness of the body from back to front is as
usual, not sufficiently great. The king has an inscription
carved upon his breast, the text of which, after having
given the name and genealogy of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal, goes
on to recount the triumphant achievements of the king
in the extension of his dominion over the whole country
between the river Tigris and Lebanon, and concludes
<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 232</span>by stating that he has made all the countries from the
rising of the sun to the setting of the sun to submit to
his feet.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span>&#8212;Shalmaneser II. (British Museum.)</p></div>

<p>Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal&#8217;s son and successor, Shalmaneser II,
has bequeathed to us one of the comparatively few examples
of an Assyrian seated figure sculptured in the
round (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig35">35</a>). The decapitated figure, which is a
representation of Shalmaneser II himself, is made of
black basalt, and it was discovered at &#7730;alat Sher&#7731;at
(Ashur). The inscription on the throne, which is partially
effaced, gives the name and titles of the king,
enumerates his various conquests in Babylonia, and
also contains an allusion to the statue itself. It is interesting
to compare this figure with the seated and
likewise decapitated figures of Gudea a millennium or
so earlier (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXIII">XXIII</a>, B). Both are made of a hard volcanic
stone, and the garment in which each of these
Eastern rulers is clad reaches down to the ankles,
though the end of Shalmaneser&#8217;s skirt is however decorated
with a fringe, while Gudea&#8217;s is quite plain. Both
figures are seated on a simple kind of throne such as
is very frequently encountered on cylinder-seals, but
there are certain striking points of difference between
the two statues. The Sumerian Gudea has no beard,
while the Semitic king of Assyria has a long square
beard, and Gudea&#8217;s arms are moreover clasped in a
reverential attitude across his breast, while Shalmaneser&#8217;s
arms are apparently resting easily upon his
lap. The feet which in each case rest upon a plinth, are
well portrayed in both figures, though what advantage
there is is clearly on the side of the earlier Babylonian
sculpture.</p>

<p>Another good example of Mesopotamian sculpture
in the round at about this time is afforded by the two
statues of the god Nebo which were excavated by
Rassam in the ruined temple of Adar at Nimrûd, one of
which is reproduced in Plate <a href="#pXXIV">XXIV</a>, A. They were made
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 233</span>by a certain governor of the city of Calah (Nimrûd),
and were dedicated to the god in the hope of thereby
ensuring length of days to Adad-nirari III, king of
Assyria from 812-783<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>, the queen Sammuramat,
and incidentally to himself also. The mention of
Sammuramat is interesting as she is supposed to be
the original of the Semiramis of later Greek and
Roman writers. The god is apparelled in a simple robe
confined at the waist, the arms being left uncovered and
free. He wears both a moustache and a beard, the
latter being curled and waved, as is also the long hair of
his head. The horned cap of the gods furnishes his
natural head-gear, and his wrists are encircled with the
rosette-patterned bracelets in which both kings and gods
seem to have delighted, while his hands are clasped upon
his breast. The inscription chiselled all round the lower
part of his robe, is chiefly concerned with a rehearsal of
all the wonderful attributes and gracious deeds of Nebo,
and ends with an exhortation to all future generations to
put their trust in Nebo, and not in any other god.</p>

<p>But neither the Babylonian nor the Assyrian sculptors
confined their attention to human beings, any more than
did the bas-relief artists. They also attempted the reproduction
of animals, mythical or real as the case may be,
with varying degrees of success. The animal that seems
to have more or less monopolized their artistic capacity
in this direction was the lion. We have already seen
the important part played by the lion in the heraldic
arms of Lagash, in the coloured decoration of walls,
and in the bas-reliefs which adorned the interiors of
Assyrian palaces, as well as in the decoration of various
objects such as mace-heads and stone bowls, and we are
accordingly not surprised to find examples of the lion
realized in hard stone and worked in the round. The
early specimens are for the most part small, and as a
rule only the heads are preserved. The dates of most
of these heads are uncertain as there is generally no
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 234</span>inscription, but fortunately there are some exceptions.
Like the majority of the earlier specimens of Sumerian
art, they nearly all come from Tellô and were excavated
by M. De Sarzec. One of the best preserved is reproduced
in Fig. <a href="#fig36">36</a>, A. Only one side of the lion&#8217;s head
has survived, but it is sufficient to demonstrate the success
with which the Sumerian sculptor treated his subject.
The arrogance and impassive majesty of the lion
are here realized more impressively than is the case with
the lions of many a European artist; this notwithstanding,
the spirit of conventionalism has already crept in
as a thief, though it has as yet only made its presence
felt in the hem of the garment so to speak. The head
itself is entirely unmarred by any deteriorating influence,
but the treatment of the mane is in a measure the
victim of the force of habit, which, in spite of the common
saying that it is &#8220;second nature,&#8221; is as a matter of fact as
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 235</span>unnatural as it can be in its effect upon art. It is formed
somewhat after the pattern of the &#8220;<i>kaunakes</i>&#8221; material
used in the manufacture of early Sumerian garments.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig36" id="fig36" />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>&#8212;A (<i>Déc. en Chald.</i>, Plate 24, I); B, C (after Heuzey).</p></div>

<p>The remains of another stone lion bearing an inscription
of Gudea, from which we gather that the lion in
question formed part of the decoration of the door
through which access was gained to the sanctuary of the
goddess Gatumdug were recovered from the same site.
This lion<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> shows still further the subtle influence of
conventionalism in the manner in which the hair on the
lower part of the belly is portrayed, a series of triangles,
such as is often seen in the figures of lions on the cylinder-seals,
representing a fringe of long hair. Many of
the lion-heads discovered at Tellô were provided with
holes for the insertion of a peg, and probably served for
lower supports of the back of thrones. One of these
lion-heads is of especial interest as it bears the name of
Ur-Ninâ, the founder of the first dynasty of Lagash,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>
while a second mentions <i>Magan</i>, the uncertain district
whence the Babylonians procured their stone. Another
early animal sculpture of some considerable interest was
discovered by Captain Cros at Tellô in 1904 (cf. Fig.
<a href="#fig36">36</a>, B). It represents a recumbent dog&#8212;apparently of
the mastiff breed, and identical in species with those
figured on Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s bas-reliefs: the length of
the dog is only about four inches, its height just under
three and a half inches, and it is two inches thick, but
the interest attaching to it lies in the fact that it bears an
inscription of one Sumu-ilu, a king of Ur who probably
reigned towards the close of the third millennium
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, but of whom little else is known, and whose name
had not even been heard of before the discovery of this
little black stone dog. The material used for this sculpture
is steatite, and the dog&#8217;s back is pierced with a hole
which served as a stand for a cylindrical steatite vase.
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 236</span>The hole and the vase are apparently of later date than
the dog itself.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>Another very interesting example of early Babylonian
sculpture in the round is that of a small human-headed
bull<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig36">36</a>, C) now preserved in the Louvre. It is,
as it were, the archetype or prototype of those winged
human-headed bulls and lions placed at the entrances of
palaces to guard against maleficent demons. The pose
of the bull is one that is entirely natural, and recalls the
semi-recumbent calves on Entemena&#8217;s silver vase (cf.
Figure <a href="#fig45">45</a>), but the body of the animal lacks the intense
realism of the earlier animal representations. He
wears a long vertically streaked beard, which is flanked
on either side by plaits of hair, and his head is surmounted
by a cap with four pairs of horns.</p>

<p>In the centre of his back there is a hole which doubtless
once served as a socket for some votive object or
figure as seems so frequently to have been the case;
but the particular interest of this little sculpture lies in
the shell inlay work on the back. The figure itself is
made of black steatite, the inlay work consisting of yellow
shell, and we have as a result a somewhat grotesquely
marked bull. Sometimes animals were carved
in wood, a good example of which is the little wooden lion
in the Louvre, but the remains of Babylonian or Assyrian
wood-carving are far too scanty to enable us to
undertake a study of their work in this direction.</p>

<p>In later times sculpture in the round, which had never
been popular with the artists of Mesopotamia owing
to the obvious difficulty of procuring the necessary
material in the first instance, and in the second to the
nature of the work itself and the obstacles which had
to be surmounted in the realization of that work, went
almost entirely out of fashion. There remain, however,
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 237</span>a few examples of sculptured animals to be considered,
among the first and foremost of which are those colossal
human-headed winged-bulls and lions which guarded
the entrances of the palaces of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal and Sargon
(cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXV">XXV</a>). They are, it is true, neither bas-reliefs
nor round sculptures, but a combination of the two,
whereby the artist has endeavoured to create a perfectly
natural and complete effect from every point of vision,
and his efforts have met with the success which they deserved.
The means he has employed to produce this satisfactory
result is the provision of each of these extraordinary
monsters with a fifth leg, though all these winged
monsters were not so provided, the principal exceptions
being the four-legged bulls in Sennacherib&#8217;s palace at
Kouyunjik. The difficulty with which the artist found
himself encountered, and which was obviated by the
above-mentioned device, lay in the inability of four legs
of natural proportions to support a stone body of the
gigantic size demanded by the architectural requirements
for which these creatures were destined to be used. In
short, a pure round sculpture of a lion or bull of the
portentous size desired was a literal impossibility, and relief
accordingly had to come into play, it being merely a
question of how far the relief should be low or high,
and the higher it was the more it of course approximated
to the round, and realized what was presumably
the artist&#8217;s real intention. The creation of a satisfactory
front view of these animals involved no difficulty, for
the visibility of the two front legs was all that was necessary,
and the drawback of the space between the legs
being occupied with the solid mass of stone which supported
the animal and out of which it was sculptured
in high relief, was comparatively slight and negligible.
But the satisfactory portrayal of the animal from the
side aspect was fraught with much greater difficulty.
Normally the two near legs of a quadruped viewed from
the side, by no means exclude the two legs on the off-side
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 238</span>from one&#8217;s vision. The artist was clearly conscious of
the difficulty which here confronted him and he has devised
an ingenious means, indeed the only means under
the circumstances for surmounting this inherent difficulty.
He has provided the lion or the bull, as the case
may be, with a fifth leg with the satisfactory result that
viewed from either standpoint the animal&#8217;s action or inaction
is conceived in a perfectly natural fashion. From
the front the winged monster is seen in a stationary
attitude, his two fore legs firmly planted together on the
ground, while from the side, on the other hand, the animal
is walking along in an entirely normal and life-like
manner. These winged monsters were placed on either
side of the portals of the king&#8217;s palace and they helped
to support the palace walls. But the object which they
were supposed to serve, and the duties which they were
expected to perform, were not of the purely architectural
or even of the decorative order, their vocation,
though embracing all these minor functions, involved
the fulfilment of yet higher obligations, for they were
destined to ward off the attacks of malicious spirits from
the nether world. Esarhaddon, king of Assyria from
681-668 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> specifically states for what purpose these
&#8220;shedi&#8221; or &#8220;lamassi&#8221;&#8212;the Assyrian names for these
semi-mythical monsters&#8212;were created and made, for
example, in one passage&#8212;to quote the translation given
by Perrot and Chipiez (p. 266)&#8212;Esarhaddon says
that &#8220;the <i>shedi</i> and <i>lamassi</i> are propitious, are the
guardians of my royal promenade and the rejoicers of
my heart, may they ever watch over the palace and never
quit its walls,&#8221; and again in another passage he says, &#8220;I
caused doors to be made in cypress, which has a good
smell, and I had them adorned with gold and silver and
fixed in the doorways. Right and left of these doorways
I caused <i>shedi</i> and <i>lamassi</i> of stone to be set up, they
are placed thereto repulse the wicked.&#8221; The front parts
of these monsters always projected beyond the general
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 239</span>line of the wall, the human head and the chest at all
events being outside the arch which these animals
supported.</p>

<p>Sometimes the winged human-headed monster is
flanked by a mythical creature with wings, holding
a basket in his left hand, and a cone in his right (cf.
Pl. <a href="#pXXV">XXV</a>), at other times he stands in isolated glory
alone. The head is of the familiar type to which
one-half of the Assyrian representations of men so
rigidly conform, the type characterized by a beard, the
other type being beardless: all the royalty and nobility
seem to have worn beards, and, according to the Assyrian
sculptors, to have had precisely the same features,
the numerous beardless figures portrayed on the bas-reliefs
representing the humbler classes, and no doubt
in some instances eunuchs. The head of this winged
colossus is surmounted by a lofty head-dress richly
decorated with rosettes, and furnished with two pairs
of horns, the ever-present mark of sacro-sanctity. The
hair and beard are profuse in their luxuriance, and
elaborate in their dressing, while the tail is treated with
the like punctilious care. Two enormous wings cover
the back, extending their overshadowing protection some
way beyond it. The relief in which the body and specifically
the legs are raised is very high, and they stand out
almost in the round. Many of these gigantic stone animals
have been found at Nimrûd, Khorsabad, the capital
of Sargon, and Nineveh.</p>

<p>But although the Assyrians show a marked predilection
for mythical monsters in their large sculptural
achievements in the round or semi-round, they showed
themselves capable of conceiving and admirably realizing
animals of the normal order; one of the best examples of
an Assyrian carved animal is the colossal lion of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal
(cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXVI">XXVI</a>), which is now in the British Museum
and once formed part of an entrance to a building.
This lion is about eight feet high and thirteen feet long,
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 240</span>and bears an inscription like many of the winged human-headed
bulls and lions. The lion also has five legs like so
many of the latter. The head is carved with great boldness
and vigour, although it is a little conventional. The
jaws are extended, the upper lip and nostrils being drawn
up, and even an unimaginative person may well fancy he
can hear a deep roar proceeding from that fierce, wide-opened
mouth. His neck is covered with a thick mane
and ruffles of stiff hair. To obtain the best view of the
sculpture, the view, that is to say, in which the spectator
will accord the full measure, or even an over-measure,
of justice to the skill of the artist, one must make one&#8217;s
point of observation on the side. The front aspect is
disappointing, as the lion is too thin for its length and
height, and is consequently deficient not only in artistic
merit, but also in the dignified majesty of which he
has ever been the symbolic incarnation. But in spite of
these obvious drawbacks, the work as a whole compels
admiration and inevitably arrests the attention, for
it possesses the &#8220;one thing needful&#8221;&#8212;life. A comparison
between the lion&#8217;s head, and that of any of the
winged human-headed monsters, at once demonstrates
the point to which allusion has so frequently been made,
the genius which the Assyrians at all times and all
periods show in the delineation of animals, and the contrasting
laboriousness with which all their representations
of human faces are invariably marked. But there
is at least one general remark which may fairly be made
of Assyrian sculpture, a remark applicable both to human
as well as animal sculptures, and that is that whether the
subject be natural or mythical, human or bestial, the
artist&#8217;s product is never without force and never lacks
impressiveness, a quality which in our own day is generally
made conspicuous by its absence. Other interesting
animal-sculptures have been found in Lower Mesopotamia,
the most famous of which is the immense black
basalt lion on the &#7730;asr mound at Babylon (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXVII">XXVII</a>).
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 241</span>It consists of a lion towering over a nude human being
lying on the ground, the whole piece being made of basalt.
The remains of another stone lion of large proportions
were discovered in the course of the recent German excavations
at Babylon; thirty fragments of the dolerite
of which it was composed have been recovered including
a portion of one of the claws, which measures over three
inches in length, and proves that the lion must have been
of abnormal size, while its general form and appearance
would seem to indicate a great age.</p>

<p>It is indeed well for us that the æsthetic genius of the
Babylonians and Assyrians should have found expression
in durable stone rather than in some other more
perishable material; the difficulties involved in sculpture
are admittedly sufficiently great, and we owe a debt of
gratitude to the perseverance and determination of those
ancient peoples, which led them to conquer and mould
for the ultimatization of their ideas, a material which a
less determined and a less persevering nation might well
have shrunk from attacking.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII&#8212;METALLURGY</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the art of working metals the Babylonians showed
no small degree of proficiency: evidence has already
been given of the way in which metal was made to contribute
her share to the perfected work of the architect,
as also of its employment as a material whereon the
scribe might engrave his comparatively imperishable
memorials, but the part which it played in the history
of the country&#8217;s art, as well as in the growth of her civilization,
remains to be considered. The metals which appear
to have been most in use among the dwellers in
Mesopotamia are copper and bronze. As in every other
country, before metal became known and utilized in the
Euphrates valley, stone was employed as the material for
making knives, axes, and implements of every kind.
Various flints were found by Taylor at Abû Shahrein
(Eridu).<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> At Fâra (Shuruppak) also, numerous flint
knives and saws, together with some hatchets and tools
made of the same material, were discovered by the German
excavators, and tools made of bone were further
found on the same site. But the copper age commenced
at a very early period in the history of Babylonian
civilization, at a time previous to the appearance
of cuneiform, and while even the earlier picture-signs
were still untrammelled by the stereotyped formalism of
later days, copper had already been adapted to the needs
and requirements of humanity.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig37" id="fig37" />
<img src="images/fig37.jpg" width="500" height="192" alt="Fig. 19." />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.</span>&#8212;A (Cat., p. 367; <i>Déc. en Chald.</i>, Pl. 5 tert. Musée du Louvre.)<br />
B (Heuzey, <i>Une Villa Royale</i>, Fig. 19.)</p></div>

<p>At Ur (Mu&#7731;eyyer) Taylor discovered a large copper
spear-head and two arrow-heads made of the same
<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 243</span>metal, while in the early strata at Tellô, M. De Sarzec
discovered a copper blade some thirty-one and a half
inches in length, and belonging to a votive-lance; unfortunately
the name of the king by whom it was dedicated
is lost owing to the oxydization of the metal, but
the title &#8220;King of Kish&#8221; is still clearly legible, Kish
being one of the most ancient sites of Euphratean civilization
(cf. Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a>, A). The tang of the blade is pierced
with four holes, and one of the flat surfaces of the blade
itself is engraved with the figure of a lion, crude indeed,
but spirited. This unique object was found at a great
depth, and only six inches above the stratum in which the
architectural remains of Ur-Ninâ were buried. Not
far distant, De Sarzec discovered an immense hollow
pipe of beaten copper (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a>, B) over ten feet long
and having a diameter of four inches; a number of copper
nails by means of which this long tube was fastened
to a wooden pole being also found. The pipe itself tapers
upwards and the top of it is crowned with a hollow ball
of hardened bitumen, a little below which there is a large
semicircular handle, or what purports to be a handle,
consisting in a hollow tube and likewise made of copper.
The use to which this strange implement was put is unknown,
but it is exactly reproduced on some of the early
cylinder-seals as well as on the well-known vase of
Gudea. Various suggestions have been made as to the
purpose which it served; one theory is that it is a chariot
<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 244</span>pole, another that it is a part of a standard, but the
former is ruled out of court by the position which it
occupies on the seals and on the aforementioned vase.
The latter, however, may be near the truth.</p>

<p>Among the earliest specimens of Babylonian metallurgy
may be mentioned a number of very small copper
representations of animals in a crouching attitude, and
all apparently belonging to the domestic order, though
in some cases they are so covered with vert-de-gris that
it is difficult to determine with precision what animals
they are intended to represent. They are probably to
be regarded as sacrificial offerings to the gods, being in
fact economical substitutes for actual victims. They
were found by De Sarzec in the lowest and therefore
earliest strata of the ruined mounds of Tellô. Another
class of metal objects to which we must also assign a
date earlier than the time of Ur-Ninâ, the founder of
the first dynasty of Lagash, comprises a number of copper
statuettes, all much the same in shape, contour and
style, though not in size. They all show a woman&#8217;s bust,
her hands clasped across her chest, and her hair hanging
about her neck like a heavy wig, while the waviness of
the hair is indicated by strongly-marked horizontal
lines (cf. Figure <a href="#fig38">38</a>, C). The style at once recalls the
figures on the crude bas-reliefs belonging to the same
period. A further peculiarity of these little figures is the
manner in which they all terminate in the point of a nail,
by means of which they were destined to be fixed in the
ground with a view to deterring the advance of demons
from the nether world.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig38" id="fig38" />
<img src="images/fig38.jpg" width="500" height="424" alt="Fig. 38." />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span>&#8212;A, C (cf. Cat., p. 295). Musée du Louvre.<br />
B (cf. <i>Déc. en Chald.</i>, Pl. 2 tert., No. 3).</p></div>

<p>So too Ur-Ninâ employed copper extensively as the
material for his votive statuettes. A number of these
statuettes were found at Tellô by De Sarzec; they all exhibit
much the same characteristics as the earlier figures
referred to above, and represent a woman whose hands
are clasped across her breast, and whose hair hangs down
her back in strongly marked perpendicular streaks,
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 245</span>while the body similarly finds its termination in a nail-point
destined to be stuck in the ground (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig38">38</a>, A).
But the chief point which distinguishes Ur-Ninâ&#8217;s statuettes
from those belonging to the earlier period lies in
the additional rôle which they were expected to play; not
only were they protective amulets, but they were also required
to carry stone tablets on their heads. To enable
them to bear their burden the more easily, they were
fixed into a kind of flat ring, the end of which was made
to resemble the tail of a bird, which thus assisted the head
in its otherwise arduous task (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig38">38</a>, B). Five of
these little figures still carried on their heads a thick tablet
of greyish stone, convex on the uppermost side, like
the bricks of this same king. They were generally found
buried in hollows about twenty-eight inches in breadth,
length, and height, and walled in with bricks and bitumen.
Later on in the dynasty the practice of providing
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 246</span>these statuettes with bird-tailed rings to assist in supporting
the inscribed stone tablet appears to have fallen
into disuse; at all events the statuettes of Entemena,
the fourth successor of Ur-Ninâ, show no such rings;
the alabaster tablets are simply bored with holes, into
which the head of the statuette was firmly inserted.</p>

<p>Another class of copper statuettes of somewhat later
date is that comprising the so-called &#8220;Kanephores&#8221; or
basket-carriers. The oldest of these likewise come from
Tellô: they are sometimes male, sometimes female
figures, but they all carry baskets on their heads. One
of them is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig39">39</a>, B. In this case the garment is
arranged in such a manner as to show the formation of
the legs. The inscription informs us that this statuette
was dedicated by Gudea to Nin-girsu. Regarding the
assumed contents of the baskets it is impossible to dogmatize:
possibly they are supposed to contain offerings,
but De Sarzec regarded these figures as representations
of the patesi himself, conveying clay in the sacred basket
for the construction of the temple.</p>

<p>The directions issued by the god Nin-girsu to Gudea
in a dream regarding the building of his temple, have
direct reference to a symbolical action which certainly
has a close resemblance to that in which these Kanephorous
figures appear to be engaged. Gudea was presented
with a sacred brick on a cushion, which, after
the performance of various rites and ceremonies, he
placed upon his head and carried to the temple&#8212;an outward
and visible sign of his obedience to the divine will
and of his determination to restore the time-honoured
fane of his god. But whatever the correct interpretation
of these Kanephorous figures be, they certainly
recall the task in which Ur-Ninâ is engaged on the
famous bas-relief in which he is portrayed surrounded
by his family and the court (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig26">26</a>).</p>

<p>Another of the same class of figures and also reproduced
in Heuzey and De Sarsec&#8217;s monumental work,
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 247</span>bears an inscription of Dungi, king of Ur (<i>circ.</i> 2400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>),
but the lower limbs instead of being modelled out, are
in the form of a cone; the other statuette illustrated on
the same plate<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> is on the contrary very carefully
modelled, and is clad in a short garment reaching to
the knees, but unfortunately bears no inscription.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig39" id="fig39" />
<img src="images/fig39.jpg" width="500" height="538" alt="Fig. 39." />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span>&#8212;A, B, C (cf. Cat., pp. 315, 307, 301; Nos. 164, 158, 146).<br />
Musée du Louvre.</p></div>

<p>Some centuries later the Elamite conquerors, Kudur-Mabug
and his son Rîm-Sin, who established their
supremacy over the whole of Sumer and Akkad and
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 248</span>maintained their position till Khammurabi, the then
king of Babylon, defeated Rîm-Sin in his thirty-first
year, caused their names to be inscribed on similar statuettes
(cf. Fig. <a href="#fig39">39</a>, A).</p>

<p>The figure here reproduced is that of a woman; her
garment, which is of the nature of a skirt, allows us no
view of the feet, and itself tapers downwards and recalls
the earlier nail-pointed statuettes. The nudity of the
bust, and the absence of hair on the head, are indications
that the woman in question is a slave, and her
vocation was probably to assist in the building of the
temples of the gods. In style this figure is more boldly
executed than the earlier statuette of Gudea seen in
Fig. <a href="#fig39">39</a>, B. It bears an inscription in which mention is
made of Kudur-Mabug and his son Rîm-Sin.</p>

<p>Sometimes male Kanephores occur, a good example
of which is preserved in the British Museum; it came
from Tellô like so many of these early works of art.
Another excellent specimen was presented some few
years ago to the Berlin Museum; it is rather more than
ten inches in height, and bears a very clearly written Sumerian
inscription; the names of Kudur-Mabug and
Rîm-Sin occur, and the statuette was dedicated &#8220;for the
preservation of life,&#8221; as was always the case with these
votive-figures.</p>

<p>Another interesting class of copper figures was further
discovered by De Sarzec at Tellô: it consisted in a
number of small statuettes most of which were dedicated
by the patesi Gudea; each is in a kneeling posture and
holds a cone between his hands, while the head-dress
consists in the horned cap characteristic of all Mesopotamian
deities, whether early or late. These little figures
are about eight or nine inches high. The cones are inscribed
with a votive inscription, and the cones themselves
must probably be regarded as religious symbols.
Cones made of clay or stone belonging to this period are
common enough, their occurrence however in copper
<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 249</span>and in immediate contact with the statue of a human
being is very rare. A plain long copper cone measuring
1 foot 1-1/2 inches in length, and bearing an archaic inscription,
is now preserved in the British Museum, this is
however an exception, metal cones being, on their rare
occurrence in Babylonian art, in nearly all cases associated
with human or quasi-divine figures.</p>

<p>One of the best and also earliest examples of these copper
cone-statuettes is that of Ur-bau (<i>circ.</i> 2500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>)
patesi of Lagash, now preserved in the Louvre, and reproduced
in figure 39, C. This figure was found enclosed
in a clay vase in the bottom of which three holes
had been bored, and it was accompanied by a fine white
marble tablet, the inscription upon which is a kind of
résumé of the text found on the statue of this patesi.
The god is kneeling on one knee, and his hands are
fixed firmly on an elongated cone which resembles the
nail-pointed terminations of the earlier figures. The
head-dress consists in the horned cap. The features are
full of expression and force in spite of their heaviness,
and the statuette as a whole shows a great advance on
the artistic products of the time of the first dynasty of
Lagash, and also compares very favourably with the later
work of Gudea&#8217;s time.</p>

<p>Among other early copper objects of interest we may
especially mention two bulls&#8217; heads the casting of which
is not solid, as is the case with all the figures hitherto
referred to, but hollow, and a curious vase, all found
together at Tellô in the stratum immediately above that
representing the age of Ur-Ninâ.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> The bulls&#8217; heads
(cf. Fig. <a href="#fig40">40</a>, A) are practically identical in type though
not in size; the horns are long and the muzzle short, but
notwithstanding their crudeness these heads are full of vitality, and
are not without a charm of their own. The larger of the
two, which is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig40">40</a>, A, has its eyes inlaid with
mother-of-pearl, while the pupils of the eyes are made
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 250</span>of lapis lazuli; it is some seven and a half inches high
(including the horns), the smaller head being only five
and a half inches in height.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig40" id="fig40" />

E (from Harper, <i>A. J. S. L.</i>, XX, p. 266).&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>At Fâra an exquisite head of a Markhur goat was discovered
(cf. Fig. <a href="#fig40">40</a>, B); the head itself is made of copper,
but the eyes were made of shell, the white of them
being represented by white shell, and the pupils by dark
brown. Between the eyes there is a three-cornered
ornament of mother-of-pearl inlaid with white and brown
shells. The gazelle&#8217;s neck is hollow, and its head was
attached to a wooden body overlaid with copper.</p>

<p>Another interesting representation of the animal world
in metal, has been bequeathed to us by Dungi, king of
Ur, and consists in a bull reclining on the top of a long
nail (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig40">40</a>, C). The bull recalls the sacrificial
animal portrayed on the little sculptured block reproduced
in Fig. <a href="#fig27">27</a>. The horns are short as there, but the
<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 251</span>thick neck and inflated throat at once give us the idea of
a bellowing bull, the attitude being wonderfully natural,
and the whole work full of vigour and animation. It is
about twenty-six inches in height.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig40">40</a>, D<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> we have an illustration of another little
metal bull, the metal in this case being bronze&#8212;an indication
of a somewhat later date&#8212;and the posture a standing
one. The place of its discovery is uncertain, but as
M. Heuzey says, it shows no trace of hard Assyrian
conventionalism, but on the contrary has all the characteristics
proper to early Babylonian art. The bull, which
is twelve inches in height and thirteen inches in length,
stands on a narrow plinth to the bottom of which a nail
was apparently fixed, recalling the nail-pointed statuettes
from Tellô. The particular interest of this little figure
lies in the fact that it is inlaid with silver, the object of
which was clearly to represent the markings of a certain
breed of bulls. The eyes were once inlaid with this metal,
and the thin plates of silver with which the body of the
animal was inlaid are still in place. This little figure thus
proves that the Babylonians had not only acquired the
art of inlaying objects made of stone, but also those that
were made of metal.</p>

<p>Among other early Babylonian representations of animals
in metal, may be mentioned a &#8220;bronze lion-headed
object&#8221; (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig40">40</a>, E) discovered at Bismâya.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> The spike
itself, apart from the lion, measures nineteen inches. As
it was found over eight feet below a platform of plano-convex
bricks, its antiquity must be very great, and in
the light of subsequent research it may probably be assumed
that it is bronze only in appearance, like so many
of the products of early Sumerian metallurgy, any alloy
there may be in the copper being at this date accidental
and not intentional. The lion is crude, but the artist&#8217;s
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 252</span>inexperience has not prevented him from producing an
animal both natural in its pose, and therefore artistic in
its effects.</p>

<p>Various other objects and weapons made of copper
have been discovered at Nippur, Fâra, Tell Sifr, and
other Babylonian sites, and they include hammers,
knives, daggers, hatchets, fetters, mirrors, fish-hooks,
net-weights, spear-heads, vases, dishes and caldrons, the
weapons sometimes having rivets for wooden handles,
which have long since perished.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>The moulds in which all these copper objects, both
hollow and solid, were cast were probably made of
clay, though in later times stone was frequently used as
a material for making moulds for metal-casting, and
various examples of such moulds made of steatite,
wherein were cast ear-rings and other articles of jewellery,
are now in the British Museum, while at the same
late period bronze itself seems to have been employed,
and bronze moulds for arrow-heads are still
extant. But there is no evidence for the use of either
stone or metal moulds among the Sumerians, and it is to
their use of clay moulds that we must doubtless ascribe,
at least in part, the extraordinary animation which these
early Babylonian figures exhibit, for obviously the
fashioning of the head of a bull or of a human being in
clay would be a comparatively easy work to chiselling
it in stone, and the work would consequently lack the
heavy laboriousness which is so often the outstanding
characteristic of early stone sculptures. The copper remains
of this age are far from being as ample as one might
wish, but many weapons, tools and other objects which
must undoubtedly have been made of metal, and therefore
probably of copper at this time, are portrayed on
some of the earliest Babylonian reliefs and seals, and give
us some idea of the extensive use which the Babylonians
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 253</span>of this remote period must have made of metal, and of
the numerous purposes for which they employed it.
Sometimes it would appear that instead of fashioning
the required objects by means of moulds, they relied entirely
on the hammer: evidence of this was forthcoming
by the discovery of a portion of the horn of an ox by De
Sarzec at Tellô. Unfortunately no other part of the
animal to which this horn belonged was brought to light,
but the horn is life-size and well made. The core consisted
of wood upon which the copper plates were fixed
by means of small nails.</p>

<p>The exact time when the Mesopotamians acquired and
practised the art of adding a percentage of tin to the
copper, thereby making it bronze&#8212;a metal possessed of
greater strength than copper&#8212;is not known, but a judgment
based on the evidence afforded by the cases which
have been actually chemically analysed, would indicate
that the artificial combination of copper and tin was not
known till the Assyrian era, and that any percentage of
tin or antimony found in the copper objects of earlier
date is a natural and not an artificial alloy. It is however
worthy of note that apparently as early as the time of
Bur-Sin, king of Ur (<i>circ.</i> 2400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), the art of mixing
metals was not unknown. At all events a copper statuette
of the Kanephorous order, and bearing an inscription
of this king, contains an alloy of lead, the percentage
of lead being as much as eighteen per cent. But with
the rise of Assyrian power, bronze gradually supplanted
copper; copper was indeed still used, and Esarhaddon,
for example, informs us that he made the doors of one of
the palaces which he erected for himself, of cypress wood,
and that he further overlaid them with silver and copper;
it was also used for subordinate purposes, as for example
in the manufacture of colour,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> but it ceased to occupy
an important place in the life of the people, though of
course as the principal contributor to the artificially
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 254</span>composed bronze it was still used extensively, though in
a less conspicuous manner.</p>

<p>A good example of the use of bronze in the early
Assyrian period is to be found in a scimitar (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>, A)
bearing an inscription of Adad-nirari I, king of Assyria
about 1325 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> The whole length of the sword is just
over twenty-one inches, the length of the blade being
sixteen inches, and that of the hilt about five, while its
width varies from just over one to just under two inches.
The sword was evidently a ceremonial one, and possibly
was at one time placed in the hand of a god&#8217;s statue;
its hilt was apparently jewelled and inlaid with ivory,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>
and it resembles that found by Macalister at Gezer in
Southern Palestine. It is interesting to compare the
scimitar of Adad-nirari with the sword found by Andrae
at Ashur (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>, B) from which it differs entirely in
character and design, the latter being perfectly straight.
Another interesting discovery made by Andrae on the
same site is a bronze axe (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>, C), which is quite
modern in its appearance, and is not unlike a short-handled
ice-axe.</p>

<p>Many other weapons, implements, dishes, bowls and
<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 255</span>rings of bronze were discovered at Nineveh, Nimrûd
and elsewhere. In Plate <a href="#pXXVIII">XXVIII</a>, we have a bronze
ox-hoof, which apparently formed the leg of a throne,&#8212;and
two other bronze fittings of a throne. Below
are two of the bronze lion-weights from Nimrûd.
Many of these weights are inscribed in cuneiform
with the names of the kings in whose reigns they
were made, e.g. Tiglath-Pileser, Shalmaneser IV and
Sennacherib, the amounts they weighed being inscribed
in Ph&#339;nician. They were possibly made by Ph&#339;nician
immigrants. The specific gravity required in the
case of each weight was normally arrived at by chiselling
pieces off the base, but in one case, the gravity had
to be increased and not diminished, and this was effected
by filling the hollow body of the lion with lead, until
it weighed the necessary amount. Immediately above
the head of the larger of the two lions here represented,
we see the bronze head of a Babylonian demon.</p>

<p>Assyrian bronze generally contains one part of tin to
ten of copper, but in the case of the bronze bells found
by Layard at Nimrûd (one of which is reproduced in
Plate <a href="#pXXVIII">XXVIII</a>), it was found by analysis that the percentage
of tin was about fourteen. This was doubtless to
make their ring more resonant. The bells in question
vary in size, the largest being about three and a quarter
inches in height and two and a quarter in diameter,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> while
the smallest is one and three-quarter inches high and one
and a quarter inches in diameter. The clappers of these
bells are made of iron.</p>

<p>But the bronze dishes from Nimrûd show the Assyrian
metal-engravers&#8217; work perhaps at its highest, and offer
more material for the study of that branch of Assyrian
metallurgy than any other class of objects. The general
style of decoration to which they conform is that determined
by concentric circles cutting up the upper surface of
the dish into so many registers, though sometimes nearly
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 256</span>the whole of the field is occupied with one scene. The
figures portrayed frequently exhibit a very strong Egyptian
influence, and are sometimes entirely Egyptian in
design.</p>

<p>In Plate <a href="#pXXIX">XXIX</a> we have a reproduction of one of the
best preserved of these bronze dishes found by Layard at
Nimrûd. The griffins which occupy the principal place in
the scheme of decoration are entirely Egyptian in conception,
while they further wear on their heads the
familiar double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. The
front left hoof of each griffin rests in an almost parental
fashion upon the head of a child, who is also clearly
Egyptian. Both before, between and behind the griffins,
tapering columns such as are frequently found in Egyptian
architecture are observable, and in the centre of the
space separating the back of one griffin from the back of
the nearest animal in the adjoining group, there is a more
substantial pillar, the capital of which is shaped to represent
a winged scarab. The animals are all beaten out in
relief, but the finely chased circles of fleurettes which
form the sole decoration of the centre, are the work of
the engraver.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig42">42</a> on the other hand we have a dish also made of
bronze, and found on the same site as the one described
above, but it betrays not the slightest trace of Egyptian
influence. The motif is one frequently employed in
Mesopotamia; the decoration of circular objects by consecutive
chains of animals following each other round in
a circle was no invention of the Assyrians, for it may be
traced back to the earliest Sumerian times. It occurs on
the famous silver vase of Entemena (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>) as well
as on the stone mace-head of Mesilim (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig26">26</a>), which
is decorated with a group of wonderfully life-like lions
pursuing each other round the mace. In the innermost
circle, a troop of gazelles, such as are often seen depicted
on cylinder-seals (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>), march along in file; the
middle register forms the circus for a variety of animals
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 257</span>all marching in the same direction as the gazelles. A bull,
a winged griffin, an ibex and a gazelle, are followed by two
bulls who are being attacked by lions, and a griffin, a
bull, and a gazelle, who are all respectively being attacked
by leopards. In the outermost zone there is a stately
procession of realistically conceived bulls marching in
the opposite direction to the animals parading in the two
inner circles, and thus relieving the otherwise aggressive
monotony of the decorations. The preservation of the
handle by which it was held or suspended is an additional
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 258</span>point of interest. Unfortunately these platters bear no
cuneiform inscriptions, though a few of them contain an
inscription written in Ph&#339;nician characters on the reverse,
which is probably an indication that they were
fashioned by Ph&#339;nician artists, if they were not actually
made in Ph&#339;nicia itself. As has been already stated,
some of the dishes under consideration are clearly Assyrian
in art and conception, while others are as certainly
Egyptian, but notwithstanding this fact, there is evidence
to show that those betokening the greatest Egyptian
influence did not originate in Egypt, and were probably
not the work of Egyptian artists. One of these
dishes for example is decorated with a circle of cartouches
containing Egyptian hieroglyphs: but the hieroglyphs
are placed together quite haphazard, they mean nothing,
and this fact alone would suggest that the artist, whoever
he was, was not an Egyptian but a plagiarist.</p>

<p>The varying and distinct styles of art to which the
decorations of these different dishes conform, are illustrated
again in an equally conspicuous manner in the
carved ivories, which were discovered on the same site
and in the same palace.</p>

<p>As has been already seen, engraving was not the
only manner in which the Assyrians utilized metal
for artistic and pictorial purposes; they also learned
to excel in metal repoussé work, a process whereby
the figures are beaten out in relief on the reverse,
though they are sometimes finished off with a graver
on the right side. The bronze gate-bands discovered
by Rassam at Balâwât are by far the largest and
most important monument of this branch of Assyrian
metallurgy. Balâwât is situated about fifteen miles
south-east of Nineveh, and on this site Rassam discovered
the remains of four pairs of large folding-doors.
Of two pairs of these doors the cedar-wood backing still
remained, but all that remained of the other two were
the bronze bands which were nailed on to the doors
<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 259</span>themselves for decorative purposes. These bands were
fashioned and affixed to the wooden doors by Shalmaneser
II, king of Assyria from 860 to 825<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span> The
largest of these doors was nearly twenty-two feet in
height, six feet in width and three inches thick. Each of
these doors was attached to a rounded post, the diameter
of which was about eighteen inches, and the foot of
which was covered with bronze with a view to facilitating
its revolution in the stone gate-socket which was
destined to hold it and the affixed door.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span>&#8212;Bronze gate-band from Balâwât. (British Museum.)</p></div>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig43">43</a> we have a reproduction of a portion of one
of these bands. In the upper register we have a procession
of foot-soldiers armed with maces, swords,
bows and quivers, and also a charioteer, all in attendance
on the king, who goes before; in the lower
register a number of chariots are seen crossing a river by
means of a bridge of boats. The whole is beaten out in
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 260</span>relief on the reverse, with the exception of fine lines
representing the horses&#8217; trappings or the decoration of
garments. Strange to say, the reins of the chariot horses
on these gate-sheaths are sometimes raised in relief by
the repoussé method, sometimes on the other hand they
are incised. At the top and bottom of each register a
row of the ubiquitous rosettes are introduced as a decorative
accessory, and the nails which fastened the metal
bands to the woodwork transfixed the rosettes. In
Fig. <a href="#fig44">44</a> we have another scene in which is represented
the capture of a certain city called Dabigu. The centre
of the upper register is occupied with a representation
of the Assyrian camp, within which the king is seen
seated before the royal pavilion and attended by two
eunuchs, while behind the camp there is another band
of eunuchs, and in front to the right of the register there
is a detachment of bowmen. Below, the assault of the
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 261</span>city &#8220;by the assault of engines and the attack of foot
soldiers and mines and breaches&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> is vividly represented.
The city itself has apparently an outer and an
inner wall, both of which are crenelated as usual. The
outer wall has an arched gate to the left, while within
the city there are various conical shaped objects which
recall the domed and conical roofs seen in Fig. <a href="#fig9">9</a>. Three
archers are defending the inner wall of the city, while
only one archer and another warrior remain at their
posts on the outer wall, the lower part of which appears
to be speedily succumbing to the irresistible attack of the
battering-ram. The latter has six wheels and seems to
bear a kind of platform on which some Assyrian soldiers
have taken their stand and from which they are discharging
their unerring shafts; behind are a troop of
archers actively engaged though very passively portrayed,
as is always the case with Assyrian representations
of human beings.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>In the recent excavations conducted by the Deutsche
Orient-Gesellschaft at Ashur, bronze plates for overlaying
and decorating doors, precisely similar to those
found by Rassam at Balâwât, were brought to light.</p>

<p>But bronze found its natural sphere of use in the
necessities of daily life, and afforded a first-class material
wherefrom to fashion knives, tools, swords, and implements
of all kinds; many of these have been brought
to light by Layard and other excavators, while without
doubt the innumerable spears, swords, shields and
arrows depicted on the Assyrian bas-reliefs were made
of this metal. It was used also in the manufacture of
personal ornaments, such as finger rings and bracelets.
Bronze was similarly used in Babylonia during the Neo-Babylonian
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 262</span>dynasty, and was employed for building as
well as for other purposes; doorsteps were sometimes
made of bronze, and one such bronze step bearing an
inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II (cf. above, p. <a href="#Page_131">131</a>) is
preserved in the British Museum. It is interesting to
note the discovery of similar bronze doorsteps by the
French excavators at Susa, especially bearing in mind
the close relationship which existed between the two
countries and peoples throughout their history, though
unfortunately Mesopotamia has at present offered no
parallel to the life-size statue in bronze of Napir-asu,
the wife of Untash-gal king of Elam about 1600<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>
A small bronze plaque bearing in relief the four-winged
demon of the south-west winds was discovered by
Layard, and is now preserved in the British Museum
(No. 86262), while a statuette of the same picturesque
creature and made of the same material now adorns the
galleries of the Louvre. The demon in question is of
a highly composite character like so many of the Babylonian
and Assyrian genii. His body resembles that of
a dog, his arms find their natural or unnatural termination
in lion&#8217;s claws, his head is a caricature of a human
skeleton, which is in its turn crowned with the horns
of a goat, his tail is that of a scorpion, and his back is
protected with four huge wings, which in their extended
position form a grim and fitting background to the
whole. But this demon, hideous as it is, was constructed
for distinctly beneficent purposes, and was used as a
talisman. One perhaps might not have at once conjectured
that this fascinating personage was really the
embodiment of the south-west wind, but fortunately
he bears an inscription on his back which removes all
doubt on the point. He was destined to be suspended
from the door or window of a house in order to scare
away any spirits of evil or doubtful intentions. The
figure is unnatural in its conception, but it is grimly
realistic and full of life, if not life-like, and in some
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 263</span>ways recalls the hideous wicker-work and feather-covered
war-gods of the Hawaiians.</p>

<p>Gold has not been found as frequently as one could
wish in the course of Babylonian and Assyrian excavations;
doubtless this is in part due to the depredations
of booty-hunters, but it is nevertheless an indication
that it was only used for exceptional purposes as is
indeed the case with us to-day. It was regularly used
for commercial transactions; a good example of its use
in this connection is afforded by a tablet belonging to
the Kassite period, the text of which is to be found in
Vol. XIV (40) of the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s
publication.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> A woman agrees to adopt a girl, tend her
during life, and after death offer libations of water for
the repose of her soul, and as consideration she receives
the sum of seven shekels of gold. One of the earliest
pieces of gold actually discovered in Babylonia is the
narrow strip inscribed with the name of Narâm-Sin of
Agade, to which we have already had occasion to allude
(cf. p. <a href="#Page_103">103</a>).</p>

<p>But gold was also employed for decorative purposes;
at Abû Shahrein (Eridu) for example, Taylor
found various fragments of gold on the base of the
second storey of the ziggurat,&#8212;apparently the remains
of the ornamentation of the sanctuary which doubtless
crowned the tower; gold-headed nails and fragments
of gold leaf were also found on the same site. In the
course of the recent excavations at Ashur, a representation
of lightning in gold, about a foot and a half
in length, which doubtless was once in the grasp of the
hand of a life-size statue of Adad, the storm-god, was
brought to light. The handle was made of wood, but
was covered with a thin sheath of pure gold. The
three-pronged end, of which only two remain, was
welded to this covering. The whole is said to weigh
about 290 grains, 250 of which represent the weight
<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 264</span>of the gold. At Babylon, the most famous of all the
cities in the Euphrates valley, gold was employed with
great prodigality. As early as the first dynasty of
Babylon it was used in the service of the gods, and
Sumu-la-ilu, the second king of this dynasty, built a
throne of gold and silver for the great lord Marduk,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>
while the statues of the gods themselves were frequently
made wholly or in part of pure gold; thus for
example Nabû-aplu-iddina, king of Babylon <i>circ.</i> 870<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>,
tells us that he carefully prepared the image of Shamash,
the Sun-god, with pure gold and lapis lazuli, while the
famous statue of Marduk of Babylon would also appear
to have been made of pure gold.</p>

<p>The temple of E-sagil erected at Babylon in honour
of this same god was covered with gold, silver and
precious stones by Ashur-bani-pal,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> king of Assyria
from 668 to 626<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span> Yet later Nebuchadnezzar added
his contribution to the great work of restoration; he
built a certain magnificent chamber called Ekua, the
walls of which he made of pure gold, and the cedar-wood
roof of which he also covered with the same precious
metal, while he similarly decorated the cedar-wood
roof of Nabû&#8217;s shrine with gold. Gold was further used
for personal adornment; in the Amran mound at Babylon,
which represents the site of the world-renowned
E-sagil, a gold ear-ring was found upon a platform composed
of bricks bearing the name of Nebuchadnezzar,
and therefore possibly belonging to his time, while a
plate of gold was also found in the same neighbourhood,
and rings of gold are perpetually mentioned in Babylonian
and Assyrian literature.</p>

<p>Many golden face-masks, ear-rings, necklaces and
other pieces of jewellery have been found in Babylonia,
but for the most part their date is uncertain, the only
certainty about them being their comparative lateness:
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 265</span>they may probably be assigned to the Sassanidian
period, and consequently their treatment will be outside
the scope of the present volume.</p>

<p>Silver was also used for much the same purposes as
those for which gold was employed. The finest and at
the same time the earliest specimen of the Babylonian
silversmith&#8217;s art has been bequeathed to us by

Entemena, one of the more
famous rulers of the first dynasty
of Lagash, and takes the
form of a magnificent silver vase.
This renowned vase (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>)
is some twenty-eight inches in
height, and rests upon a copper
base seven inches high, while
the largest diameter is eighteen
inches. The copper base is supported
by four feet resembling
the paws of lions, and on the
centre of the vase just above
two of these feet, is engraved
the lion-headed eagle with outstretched
wings whose two claws
firmly grip the backs of two
lions facing in opposite directions,
a motif frequently found
on the works of art belonging to
the period of the first dynasty
of Lagash, and representing the heraldic arms of that
ancient city. Above the other two feet of the base the
motif is slightly varied, the two lions being exchanged
in one case for two deer, in the other for two goats.
Each lion is engaged in putting its teeth into the mouth
of the deer or the goat of the adjoining group, the whole
thus forming a continuous chain admirably suited for
the decoration of a circular vase. The lion-headed
eagles and their submissive animals, are separated from
<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 266</span>the upper and lower portions of the vase by means of
a double fish-bone line; upon the upper part of the vase
are seven heifers all facing in the same direction, and all
in a semi-reclining attitude, one of their fore-legs being
raised preparatory to standing up; these heifers are marvellously
life-like and true to nature, and already we
seem to see in them the forerunners of those masterpieces
of Assyrian art which adorned the palace walls
of Ashur-bani-pal. This scene of country life was evidently
very popular at this period, it occurs on the little
sculptured block seen in Fig. <a href="#fig27">27</a>, as well as elsewhere.
But success in the reproduction of animal life at this
epoch seems to have been largely conditioned by the
artist&#8217;s abstention from trying to depict the animals full-face;
when he aspires to the latter the result is amazingly
stereotyped and formal, and a comparison between
the lion-headed eagles and the lions on the one hand,
and these spirited heifers, at once reveals the contrast,
as well as the cause of the contrast. The artist himself
was evidently conscious of his failure, for he has striven,
but it must be admitted without much success, to impart
life to his lions and lion-headed eagles by elaborating the
wings of the one and the mane of the other by means of
an altogether extravagant amount of detailed attention.
The inscription round the neck informs us that this vase
was dedicated by Entemena, the fourth successor of
Ur-Ninâ, to the god Nin-girsu in his temple Eninnu,
during the priesthood of one Dudu, whose name
also occurs on the little sculptured block (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig27">27</a>),
thus proving the contemporaneity, which the style of
art to which the decorations on both conform would
have independently led us to infer.</p>

<p>But silver sometimes played a subsidiary, though
nevertheless from the artistic point of view an essential
part in the decoration of metal figures: a good example
of the latter is afforded by a bronze figure of a bull,
already referred to (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig40">40</a>, D).</p>

<p><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 267</span></p>

<p>It is somewhat uncertain whence they obtained their
silver; in a letter of Lu-enna to Enitarzi, a ruler who
apparently flourished shortly after the first dynasty of
Lagash, silver is mentioned as forming part of the booty
taken from Elam, and in later times it was one of the
principal items of tribute exacted by the Assyrian kings
from their vassal princes, and as such, is frequently
mentioned on the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser II. The
excavations have yielded very few relics made of this
material, the reason again being probably due to the
predatory raids of booty-hunters. Of smaller objects
belonging to the Assyrian period may be mentioned a
silver bell with a bronze clapper, a silver ring set with
a garnet, and a silver bracelet, all in the British Museum,
but the dates of these are unfortunately quite uncertain.
That it was used extensively, however, is shown
not only by the important place which it occupies in
the tribute brought by subject tribes and peoples, but
also by the allusions made to this metal in the royal
inscriptions. Thus Esarhaddon informs us that he
covered the doors of one of his palaces with this
precious metal. Idols were also sometimes made of
silver as well as of gold, to both of which classes
Tiglath-Pileser I makes allusion in one of his inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>With two of the so-called &#8220;baser metals&#8221; we have
already had occasion to deal at some length, owing to
the important part they played in the civilization of the
Babylonians and Assyrians, but we have tangible as well
as linguistic evidence of their acquaintance with and
utilization of other metals as well as gold, silver, copper
and bronze. It has been shown that lead was sometimes
used as an alloy, but it was sometimes used in its
unmixed state; a very interesting example of its use
in this latter condition is to be found in a gate-socket
now preserved in the British Museum. The socket itself
<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 268</span>is made of bronze, but it is set in solid lead. The
date of this unique object is uncertain, but it may probably
be assigned to the Assyrian era. Few leaden objects
have as yet been yielded by the excavations, though it
is frequently mentioned as forming part of the tribute
of subject peoples, and we know that it was used in the
manufacture of colours, as well as being placed inside
the hollow lion-weights found at Nimrûd to add the
specific gravity required. In Egypt lead would appear
to have been known and used at a very early period,
judging from the little statuette in the British Museum,
which apparently dates from about the time of the First
Dynasty, and is said to be made of solid lead.</p>

<p>Iron was first known to the Babylonians in its meteoric
state, for its designation is <span class="smcap">AN-BAR</span>, which signifies
&#8220;stone of heaven.&#8221; Allusions to objects made of this
metal are very frequent in the inscriptions of Assyrian
kings. Tiglath-Pileser I for example makes reference
to a certain lance of iron, and Shalmaneser II to the
point of an iron dagger, while both the latter king
and Adadnirari III mention iron as forming part of
the tribute they received from their vassal-kings.
A century later Tiglath-Pileser III records that he
put iron chains upon a certain Zaquriu and his followers,
while a hundred years after, Ashur-bani-pal refers to
an iron dagger overlaid with gold.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>Place found a number of iron axe-heads, knives and
other implements at Khorsabad, while Layard discovered
a bracelet, a lock-plate, some spear-heads, two reaping-hooks,
rings and staples, axe-heads, arrow-heads, finger-rings
and a part of a helmet, all made of iron, in the
north-west palace at Nimrûd. An interesting specimen
of oriental ironwork was found at Babylon by the
German excavators in the shape of an iron rod beautifully
decorated with a series of polished ornaments, and
possibly formed part of a royal throne. Lastly many of
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 269</span>the Assyrian bronze bells already alluded to have
tongues made of iron.</p>

<p>Iron was apparently not known or at all events not
used in Mesopotamia as early as it was in Egypt. Evidence
of its use in the early dynastic period was afforded
by Maspero&#8217;s discovery of this metal in a fifth dynasty
pyramid in 1882, and Petrie discovered a piece of
worked iron in sixth dynasty deposits, while in the year
1837 iron was discovered in the Great Pyramid of Gizeh.</p>

<p>Sufficient will have been said to indicate the important
part played by metal in the history of both the Babylonians
and Assyrians; not only was it used as a commercial
medium of exchange, it was also adapted to the
innumerable requirements of humanity; implements,
weapons, vases, personal decorations were all easily
realized in this pliable and at the same time durable
substance, while the artistic genius of the Mesopotamian
population which finds its most perfect expression
in the sculptured bas-reliefs of early and late date, was
entirely dependent on the forging of metal tools and
implements for the purpose.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII&#8212;PAINTING</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;P</span>AINTING&#8221; in the ordinary sense of the word
to-day, was an art never practised by the dwellers
in Mesopotamia: like all Orientals both the Babylonians
and Assyrians were fond of gay colours, and they gratified
their taste for such in various ways, but as a rule no
attempt was made to faithfully represent the objects of
nature through the medium of the brush and the employment
of colours alone, and the colours which they used
on their sculptured reliefs, their stuccoed walls, or their
enamelled bricks, were very frequently entirely impossible
from the naturalistic standpoint. Thus the lion of
brilliant yellow hue (cf. <a href="#f">frontispiece</a>), the commonest of
all pictorial representations in Babylonia, has no counterpart
whatever in real life; the effect is pleasing, it catches
the eye, it awakens a sense of appreciation in the spectator,
but this is due to the general cheerfulness of the
colours themselves, certainly not to their fidelity to
nature.</p>

<p>The lion itself bears no comparison with the Babylonian
lion represented in Fig. <a href="#fig46">46</a>. The action is the
same in either case&#8212;both lions are proceeding with sure
and deliberate step, roaring as they go, but there is a vast
difference between the artistic merits of each. The Assyrian
lion is not indeed entirely lifeless, but it lacks the
freedom and spontaneity which characterize the highest
forms of art; the body is also somewhat heavy and clumsy
compared with the lion of Ishtar&#8217;s Gate.</p>

<p>The colours chiefly employed in Babylonian and Assyrian
paintings are blue, yellow and white, while green,
red and black are of comparatively rare occurrence. The
<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 271</span>background of the picture is generally a shade of royal
blue, the figures, usually animals, being of a brilliant
yellow. In Babylonia, the demand for colours in architectural
decoration was naturally more pressing than in
Assyria, for in the latter country, where alabaster and
limestone were easily procurable, the adornment of the
interiors of buildings fell to the sculptor, but in the
southern country the dearth of stone at once precluded
the possibility of covering the walls even of the palaces
with the sculptured bas-reliefs so dear to the heart of apparently
all Assyrian monarchs. Thus it was that colour
was largely made to take the place of sculpture in Babylonian
decoration, the sculptor&#8217;s chisel being exchanged
for the painter&#8217;s brush, though in Assyria sometimes the
art of the sculptor and painter were both invoked to
beautify the walls of the king&#8217;s palace, for in some of the
halls in the royal residence of Sargon at Khorsabad the
sculptured reliefs on the lower part of the walls were
painted;<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> while Layard, after describing some of the
wall-reliefs found in the north-west palace at Nimrûd,
says:<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> &#8220;On all these figures paint could be faintly distinguished,
particularly on the hair, beard, eyes and
sandals,&#8221; which rather suggests that the earlier Assyrian
sculptures were only partially coloured. Some of the
sculptured bas-reliefs from Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal&#8217;s palace at
Nimrûd still bear traces of colour, the sandals of many of
the figures even now showing the faded red and black paint
which at one time covered the soles and upper parts of
the sandals respectively, while in one case Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal&#8217;s
bow still retains traces of red paint. At Khorsabad,
on the other hand, colour was used more generally, the
raiment and head-gear of the king as well as the harness of
the horses, the chariots and the trees, being all painted.
Layard says that he was unable to ascertain whether the
ground as well as the figures, or parts of the figures, were
<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 272</span>coloured, but Flandin, in regard to the wall-reliefs at
Khorsabad, informs us that he could trace a tint of yellow
ochre on all parts not otherwise coloured, while the upper
parts of the walls upon which the sculptor had lavished
none of his art, were often decorated with frescoes.</p>

<p>But walls plastered with stucco also commanded the
attention of the painter as well as those lined with
stone bas-reliefs, and Layard discovered the remains
of paintings on stucco at Nimrûd, specifically in the
upper chambers on the west side of the mound, the
rooms of which were constructed of crude bricks coated
with plaster and elaborately painted.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> Most of these
paintings do not aspire to anything more than designs,
simple or complex as the case may be. In one fresco two
bulls are portrayed facing each other; their bodies are
white, the ground from which the bulls are carefully
delineated by a pronounced black outline, being yellow,
while dark blue plays a leading part in the purely decorative
accessories at the top of the fresco. Other evidence
of the extensive use of paint for the ornamentation of
interior walls, was forthcoming in the discovery on the
floor of a chamber in the north-west palace of Nimrûd, of
&#8220;considerable remains of painted plaster still adhering
to the sun-dried bricks, which had fallen in masses from
the upper part of the wall. The colours, particularly the
blues and reds, were as brilliant and vivid when the earth
was removed from them, as they could have been when
first used. On exposure to the air they faded rapidly.
The designs were elegant and elaborate. It was found
almost impossible to preserve any portion of these ornaments,
the earth crumbling to pieces when any attempt
was made to raise it.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>The exteriors of buildings were also sometimes decorated
with colour, a notable example being the ziggurat
at Khorsabad of which three complete stages
together with a part of the fourth were found still
<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 273</span>remaining. The lowest stage was painted white, the
second black, the third red, and the fourth white;
doubtless the remaining stages were also painted, the
colours being emblematic of the seven planets, as in the
case of the traditional temple of Belus at Babylon.</p>

<p>The best example of the Babylonian painter&#8217;s art is
afforded by the city of Babylon itself. As early as the
sixties, the French excavators, Fresnel and Oppert, had
collected a large number of single-coloured and multi-coloured
fragments of relief bricks. The coating of
colour, which was always applied to the narrow sides of
the bricks, was sometimes from one to two millimetres
thick. Unfortunately this valuable collection was lost,
but the statements of the explorers are corroborated by
the description of a Babylonian palace wall, contained
in the works of Diodorus the historian (<i>circ.</i> 44<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>)
where he refers to &#8220;all manner of shapes of animals on
rough bricks with colouring very like that of nature&#8221;;
and he goes on to say that on the towers and walls were
&#8220;representations of all kinds of animals, and as far as
colouring and shape went, well done. The whole represented
a hunt, where everything was full of animals of
all kinds, and in size more than four yards. In this was
also represented Semiramis, on horseback, in the act of
throwing the spear after a panther, and a short distance
off her husband, Ninus, stabbing a lion with a lance.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>
Nebuchadnezzar himself further alludes to the pictures
of wild oxen and colossal serpents, which he caused to
be portrayed on blue enamelled bricks as decorations for
the gates. Most of the glazed and coloured tiles found
at Babylon resemble coloured bas-reliefs, the figures of
the animals standing out in relief on a blue background
generally, though sometimes the ground is green. The
brick-enameller&#8217;s art reaches its climax in the Lion-frieze
which adorned the Procession Street of Marduk, at
Babylon. One of these clay bas-relief lions is seen in
<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 274</span>Fig. <a href="#fig46">46</a>.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> The ground is dark blue, the monotony of
which is varied by the introduction of yellow stripes and
the white rosettes already so familiar from the enamelled
bricks of Khorsabad. The lion itself, the proportions
of which are excellent, stands out in white alabaster clay,
and the whole work is more perfect in technique than
<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 275</span>the Persian lion frieze at the Louvre, which it in some
ways resembles. What detracts from the artistic merit
of the latter is the disproportion which the body bears
to the fore-part and head, both of them being too small,
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 276</span>but the Babylonian lion is almost entirely free from this
defect. The discovery of the Ishtar Gate at Babylon
added another bounteous supply of material for the
study of Babylonian painting: here too the coloured
representations on the enamelled bricks were in relief.
The walls of the gate were found preserved to a height
of thirty-nine feet, the whole of the wall being covered
with animals, principally bulls and dragons, of which
there were at least eleven rows.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span>&#8212;A (after Andrae); B (after Layard).</p></div>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig47">47</a>, A, we have a black and white reproduction
of one of the clay relief bulls which adorned the gate of
Ishtar at Babylon. The bull is in the act of walking,
and exhibits both grace and dignity in his movements,
the slightness of his frame only serving to intensify the
agility with which he seems to advance. The proportions
are excellent and contrast very favourably with the Assyrian
bull from Nimrûd (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig47">47</a>, B). The latter is hard
and conventional, while the posture&#8212;in itself a sufficiently
natural one&#8212;is here rendered in a most wooden
and inanimate fashion. The body of the animal is white,
but the painter has attempted to make his subject stand
out upon its pale yellow background, by edging it with
an artificial outline of black. When the bull was coloured
blue and thrown on to a white background this device
was of course unnecessary (cf. Layard. Ser. I, Pl. 87.)
The blue bull here alluded to belongs to the same species
as the white one reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig47">47</a>, B, and is in the
same kneeling position, but he is furnished with the
wings of an eagle. It will be observed that in the Babylonian
bull, as also in both the Assyrian bulls, the artist
has evaded the difficulty of drawing the two horns in
perspective by portraying only one, the other being
theoretically concealed from view by the horn near the
spectator.</p>

<p>But the palace of Nebuchadnezzar itself contained a
large number of these coloured reliefs, many pieces of
the glazed tiles of which they were composed having
<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 277</span>been found by Koldewey. The fragments recovered,
number literally thousands, and Koldewey says that
apparently when the bricks were stolen by later builders,
the glazed portions were knocked off in order to make
them more useful for the common purposes for which
they were destined, and we to-day are the beneficiaries
of that lack of appreciation. Amongst the animals portrayed
on the palace and temple walls may be mentioned
the bull, a mythical monster compounded of
&#8220;parts of a bird of prey,&#8221; scorpions, serpents, panthers
and steers, as well as the ubiquitous lion, while some of
the fragments recovered show parts of the human body,
and birds are also sometimes encountered. The lions
form the most interesting study: there are two main
types, (1) lions walking to the left, with white skins and
yellow manes; and (2) lions walking to the right (<i>a</i>) with
white skins and yellow manes, and (<i>b</i>) yellow skins and
green manes; while there is a third type characterized
by lions running to right or left. Sometimes the tail is
portrayed standing out straight behind, sometimes it
assumes a curved and less rigid form. Great difficulty
has been experienced in fitting the various fragments
together, but the assiduous efforts of the Germans have
not been without success.</p>

<p>The process by which these coloured clay reliefs are
supposed to have been made is as follows: a layer or slab
of plastic clay of a fair size was taken, and on this surface
the complete picture was modelled in relief, the
process thus far being the same as that employed in the
ordinary stone bas-reliefs, except that a chisel was in
requisition there while here the hands would suffice,
though it seems probable that moulds were at all events
made for some of the lions, many of which are apparently
entirely uniform. However that may be, the slab
of clay now bearing in relief the figure determined, is
supposed to have been cut up into rectangular blocks
of the same size as the ordinary bricks, each rectangle
<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 278</span>being marked, with a view to simplifying the task of
fitting each into its right place in the picture; after
this, each piece was painted with a coat of coloured varnish,
and then thoroughly baked in the oven&#8212;the
thoroughness of the baking is attested by the hardness
of the enamel&#8212;after which the various parts were fitted
together. In the same way at Nimrûd, Layard found a
large number of enamelled bricks, bearing the figures
of animals and flowers as well as cuneiform characters,
lying promiscuously upon the floor of the entrance passages
to the palace, upon the unpainted backs of which
rude designs, chiefly consisting of men and animals,
were drawn in black ink or paint, &#8220;and marks having
the appearance of numbers.&#8221; The marks alluded to
must have presumably served the purpose of guiding
the builder in his attempt to reconstruct the picture on
the wall.</p>

<p>Coloured clay reliefs were not however the only
species of pictorial representation adopted in the embellishment
of the city of Babylon, or the palace of Babylon&#8217;s
most illustrious king. On the southern side of the
&#7730;asr, a large number of beautifully glazed tiles stamped
with Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s inscription and adorned with
flowers, twigs, and in one case part of a human figure&#8212;some
fourteen inches high&#8212;were discovered, together
with many sculptured stones bearing similar designs,
the workmanship of which however was more
perfect than that of the tiles. The latter have a flat surface,
but they resemble the relief tiles in general technique.
Many other glazed bricks were found on the
eastern side of the &#7730;asr, painted with various designs
and displaying great delicacy&#8212;on one of them a human
figure is portrayed, clad in a rich garment and holding
what appears to be a spear in his left hand&#8212;these however
Koldewey assigns to the Persian period.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Decorated Arch at Khorsabad</span><br />
(<i>cf. Place, &#8220;Ninive,&#8221; Plates, 14, 15</i>)</p></div>

<p>But colour was further employed, as the handmaid of
humbler forms of architectural decoration in Babylonia
<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 279</span>as well as in the northern country. Thus at Nippur, the
walls of many of the rooms were stuccoed with a plaster
consisting of mud and straw, and were coloured, the
colours used being apparently always solid. The ruins
of Nin-makh&#8217;s temple at Babylon, excavated by the
Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft, similarly showed the remains
of white decorations on its walls; while colour
played no insignificant part in the decoration of the
famous cone-wall at the Wuswas mound of Erech, the
cones of which were coloured red or black and then arranged
in a variety of geometrical patterns upon a wall
consisting of mud and straw.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, enamelled bricks were used
for the purposes of architectural decoration in Assyria as
well as in Babylonia, though the enamel used is generally
inferior in quality, and is more thinly applied, in consequence
of which it does not adhere so well to the clay,
and it fades sooner. To Place and Botta we are indebted
for the finest and largest specimens of the Assyrian
enameller&#8217;s art as yet discovered. The principal gateways
of Dûr-Sharrukîn (Khorsabad) (the town built by
Sargon, 722-705<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>), which are formed of arches resting
on the backs of projecting winged bulls, seem to
have been the object of the painter&#8217;s peculiar attention.
These arches were decorated with a semicircle of enamelled
bricks (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXX">XXX</a>), the enamel being laid upon
one edge of the bricks, the average length of which is
about three and a half inches. The ground is blue and
the composite winged figures are yellow, while a line of
green edges the lower part of the head-gear. The rosettes
which form a supplemental decoration are white. These
figures which extend over the entire round of the arch
are all uniform: they are engaged in some act of worship,
or in the performance of some religious ceremony,
and at once recall the scenes depicted on the palace wall
reliefs, with which they are practically identical. In contradistinction
to the method usually employed in Babylonia,
<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 280</span>these coloured representations are not in relief, the
colour being applied to the flat surface of the bricks, the
only exception being the central bosses of the rosettes
which are slightly raised. Another good example of
coloured tile-work was found on a plinth in the doorway
of what Place regarded as the harem in Sargon&#8217;s palace.
The plinth in question is twenty-three feet long and over
three feet high. The figures portrayed are the king,
standing on one side of the plinth with bare head, while
on the other side he wears the usual head-gear, a lion, a
bull, an eagle, a tree and a plough, all done in yellow on a
blue background, the borders of the whole plinth being
decorated with the inevitable rosettes. The leaves of
the tree are green, a colour apparently somewhat seldom
used by the enamellers of Mesopotamia. Another
painted fragment from Khorsabad, interesting for the
extreme brilliancy of its colouring (cf. Place, <i>Nineve</i>,
Pl. 32), is reproduced in Pl. <a href="#pXXXI">XXXI</a>. The faces of
the two human beings are white, the background being
green; the frieze at the top is yellow, the circular decorations
consisting of an inner circle of green or yellow, while
the outer circle is composed of trapezoidal figures of red
and white in the case of those with a green inner circle,
and red and green in those with yellow centres, arranged
in either case alternately.</p>

<p>Layard also succeeded in recovering many glazed and
coloured bricks from Nimrûd (Calah) of even greater
interest as regards the composition of the scenes depicted
than as regards the colours used, which in their
present state in no way compare with those from Khorsabad
in brilliancy. The most interesting of these (cf. Pl.
<a href="#pXXXI">XXXI</a>) is one in which the king, followed by the chief
eunuch, is seen receiving his chief officer,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> a scene so
often portrayed on the Assyrian bas-reliefs. Above his
head there is a &#8220;kind of fringed pavilion&#8221; and the sole
<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 281</span>remaining sign of a cuneiform inscription, while beneath
him is a spiral design seen more frequently on the so-called
Hittite works of art, though it is also found as a
decorative accessory on some of the earliest sculptures in
Babylonia (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig27">27</a>). The predominating colours are
black and yellow: the hair and beard of the king and his
followers, their sandals, as well as the circular balls found
within each link of the spiral chain are black, the background
is light yellow, the dress of the various figures
being of a deeper shade of yellow, and the royal head-dress
white. As Layard says: &#8220;This is an unique specimen
of an entire Assyrian painting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of the remainder, the most interesting are briefly
described by Layard in <i>Discoveries</i>, pp. 166 and 167,
and illustrated in colours in his <i>Monuments</i>, Series II,
Pls. 53-55. One of these (Pl. 54, 7) contains a picture
of four hairless and clean-shaven captives, whose four
necks are bound together by means of a rope, the end
of which is held by the prisoner in front. Two of the
prisoners wear white loin-cloths, while the other two are
clad in long white shirts opening in front. As regards
the colours, the ground is a pale blue, and the figures
are yellow. Another fragment of great interest is that
reproduced in <i>Monuments</i>, Pl. 54, 12, on which are portrayed
two horses, an Assyrian warrior, and a man holding
a dagger. The latter, who is naked with the exception
of a blue loin-cloth, has apparently been wounded or
killed in battle. The background here is olive-green,
while the horses are blue. On another glazed tile (Pl.
54, 13), we see a picture of Assyrian cavalry, again
on a ground of olive-green, but in this case the horses
are yellow, while the trappings are blue. One of these
painted bricks (Pl. 53, 1) presents us with a picture of
a blue fish on a yellow background; the scales of the
fish however are coloured white, while on the same tile
there is a man transfixed by two arrows and girded with
a white loin-cloth. On another fragment (Pl. 53, 3), a
<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 282</span>chariot to which horses are yoked is being dragged over
a naked figure, whose neck has been pierced by an arrow.
A fillet to which is attached a feather, encircles the
man&#8217;s head. The horses are blue, their trappings being
white, and the wheels of the chariot are yellow. Below
are seen the heads together with a portion of the shields
of two Assyrian soldiers. The helmets are yellow, but
the faces are &#8220;merely outlined in white on the olive-green
ground,&#8221; while the shields are blue, but are edged
with alternate squares of yellow and blue. All these belong
to the same period, but another fragment was found
by Layard (Pl. 53, 6) which appears to be of earlier
date: the background is yellow, but the outline is black
instead of white, while the figures, the heads of which
have been destroyed, are dressed in the same way as the
tribute-bearers bringing a monkey and other offerings to
Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal, as portrayed on bas-reliefs which were
taken from the same building. The outer mantle is blue,
the inner being yellow, and the fringes white.</p>

<p>But pottery was also sometimes decorated with
colours; thus Captain Cros, De Sarzec&#8217;s successor at
Tellô, discovered black pottery with incised lines filled
in with white paste on this site, a style of pottery well
known in Egypt and elsewhere, but not hitherto found
in Babylonia. At Nippur on the other hand pottery
painted with green and yellow stripes was found, while
other vases decorated with black and white discs were
also brought to light.</p>

<p>Painted pottery has been similarly found in Assyria:
at Nimrûd Sir Henry Layard&#8217;s men discovered various
fragments of pottery which apparently belonged to the
covers of jars; they were decorated with the spiral design,
also honeysuckles, cones and tulips, in black on a
pale yellow ground. Prehistoric pottery has moreover
been found in the course of the recent excavations at
Ashur, the clay vessels in question being decorated with
red and black geometrical designs. Clay slipper-shaped
<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 283</span>coffins were also sometimes coloured; many of the sarcophagi
discovered at Nippur were covered with a blue
glaze, but they belonged apparently to the Parthian
period. Glazed sarcophagi were likewise found at Warka
(i.e. the ancient Erech) as well as at the city of Babylon,
though they also were the products of a late period.
Various other terra-cotta objects were not infrequently
coated with a vitreous glaze, the colour of the enamel
being usually blue or green. Colour was not only used
in Babylonia however for decorating buildings, pots and
figures, but also apparently for the adornment of the
human body, for the German excavations at Fâra revealed
the presence of alabaster colour-dishes in the
graves, traces of the colour in some cases still remaining.
The colours are black, yellow, light green and light red.
According to the analysis of the colours of the Babylonian
bricks conducted by Sir Henry De la Becke and
Dr. Percy, quoted by Layard,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> &#8220;the yellow is an antimoniate
of lead, from which tin has also been extracted,
called Naples yellow, supposed to be comparatively a
modern discovery, though also used by the Egyptians.
The white is an enamel or glaze of oxide of tin, an invention
attributed to the Arabs of Northern Africa in
the eighth or ninth century. The blue glaze is a copper,
contains no cobalt, but some lead; a curious fact, as this
mineral was not added as a colouring material, but to
facilitate the fusion of the glaze, to which use, it was
believed, lead had only been turned in comparatively
modern times. The red is a sub-oxide of copper.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>F the smaller relics of Babylonian and Assyrian
antiquity there are none so numerous or so pregnant
with interest as the engraved seals which kings
and commoners of all periods alike possessed. The
universality of their usage in later times is attested by
Herodotus (I, 195), who tells us that in his day everyone
in Babylonia carried a seal as well as a walking-stick,
while abundant evidence of their general use in
early times is afforded by the vast quantity of seals discovered
in the course of the excavations.</p>

<p>The seal, important as it is in our own day, was an
even more indispensable convenience of civilized society
in primitive times, and was probably one of the first inventions
that owed their origins directly to the mutual
recognition of private rights of ownership. The purpose
which it first of all served was of course the same as that
which it serves with us to-day, though the sealing of the
mud plaster covering of a jar of wine, of the string of a
registered parcel, or the flap of a paper envelope, in no
way prevents the thief from robbing the contents in any
of these cases, yet it renders it impossible for such a theft
to be perpetrated without detection, detection not indeed
necessarily of the thief, but of the deed itself, and that
after all is the essential preliminary to the successful
establishment of any suit at law. Its use in primitive
times was, however, far more extensive, for, as Newberry
well puts it,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> &#8220;what locks and keys are to us, seals were to
<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 285</span>the people of the Old World.&#8221; If a man left his house
for the day, and no occupant remained to keep watch,
he probably secured himself and his goods so far as possible
by sticking plasters of mud on the door and impressing
his seal upon them in such a manner as to make
it impossible to enter the house without breaking the
seal; at all events Dr. Ward informs us<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> that he saw
in a Khan at Hillah, near Babylon, a door of a room
containing goods belonging to a merchant who was away
from home, carefully sealed up with pats of clay on which
the impress of the merchant&#8217;s seal had been duly fixed,
thereby rendering access to the house dependent on the
bursting of the seals, and in the conservative East the
customs of to-day are not merely those of yesterday, but
<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 286</span>generally represent the traditional usage of hundreds,
sometimes thousands of years. A few such sealed pats of
clay, some of which formed stoppers of jars, have been
found, but the principal object for which the cylinder-seal
was used, was the authentication of deeds, documents
and letters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig48" id="fig48" />

B, a clay tablet bearing a seal impression.<span class="vh">xxxxx</span><br />
<span class="vh">xxxxxxxxx</span>C, D, illustrate the variation in size exhibited by cylinder-seals.</p></div>

<p>The seals employed by the Babylonians and Assyrians
differed from those generally employed elsewhere, in
shape as well as in the motifs of the engravings. They
assumed the form of cylinders or rollers, through the
centre of which a single or double piece of wire was inserted,
the wire being generally made of copper, though
sometimes of gold and silver, while later on, iron also
occurs. At one end the wire was clamped, while at the
other it was twisted into a loop (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig48">48</a>, A) through
which a piece of thread or twine was passed by means of
which the seal could be slung round the owner&#8217;s neck,
or carried on his wrist, the wire at the same time facilitating
the process of rolling the cylinder on the moist clay.</p>

<p>The tablet (K. 382) seen in Fig. <a href="#fig48">48</a>, B, is a good example
of a clay tablet bearing the impress of a cylinder-seal.
The tablet, which measures 4-1/8 inches by 2-5/8 inches, contains
the terms of a contract. The impression itself
shows us a mythological four-winged being, such as is
seen so often on Assyrian bas-reliefs. In either hand
he holds a bird by the leg. The cylinders by the side
of the tablet are reproduced to actual size; A, C, and D
(Brit. Mus. Nos. 89319, 89538, 101974) illustrate the
divergence of size which the Babylonian cylinder-seals
exhibit, (C) being an unusually large specimen, and
(D) an exceptionally small example, the vast majority
of seals occupying an intermediate position between
these two extremes; in (A) we have a cylinder in which
the metal handle is still preserved.</p>

<p>The existence of the same kind of seal in Egypt as
early as the time of the first dynasty has been used as
an argument in support of the theory that the primitive
civilizations of Egypt and Babylonia were to some extent
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 287</span>interdependent. It is true that cylinder-seals could
only be of use where clay was employed as a writing-material,
but there is no direct evidence that the practice
of using clay for either writing or building purposes was
borrowed from Babylonia, while the similarity in shape
of early Babylonian and Egyptian mace-heads is an even
more uncertain argument whereon to base an otherwise
unsupported theory.</p>

<p>The materials used in the manufacture of cylinder-seals
were many and various. The earliest known material
is shell, but the most frequently occurring is hæmatite.
Among other materials used may be mentioned serpentine,
marble, quartz crystal, chalcedony, carnelian,
agate, jasper, syenite, jade, obsidian, onyx, limestone,
schist, mother of emerald, and amethyst. A few flint
cylinders have been recovered, but this material was evidently
but seldom employed, while glass is of even rarer
occurrence, and metal is unknown. The process by
which the required device was engraved upon the cylinder
depended upon the material of which the latter was
made. The softer materials employed in earlier times,
such as shell, marble or serpentine, were possibly engraved
with tools made of flint, but the harder stones
would require an implement made of some more stubborn
material. Ward is of opinion that either emery or a certain
stone called corundum was used for the purpose.
The latter was employed at a very early period in Egypt
and in later times in Greece. The earliest seals appear
to have been entirely made by hand, the practice of drilling
by means of a bowstring not being introduced till a
later period. Within the confines of a single chapter it
will of course be quite impossible to review all the innumerable
types of cylinder-seals used by the Babylonians
and Assyrians of different ages, and we can therefore
only single out one or two examples of some of the more
interesting classes as being fairly representative of the
periods to which they belong.</p>

<p>The most ancient seals are generally made of white
<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 288</span>marble, or shell, and sometimes also of lapis lazuli
and serpentine. It is impossible to assign a definite
or even an approximate date to the vast majority of
cylinder-seals recovered from the ruined mounds of
Mesopotamia, as most of them belonged to individuals
otherwise unknown, but fortunately a number of seals
have been brought to light which belong either to
kings or officials whose date can be independently
computed, and which therefore give us an illustration
of the proficiency to which the art of engraving
had been brought at the particular period in which the
owners of the seals lived, and a comparison of the style
of art exhibited on the otherwise undateable seals with
those whose age has thus been fixed, makes it possible
for us to assign them with some degree of certainty to
the period to which they belong in the history of the art
of seal-engraving.</p>

<p>The interest of these small relics of the past is of
course centred in the scenes depicted, which are very
various, and which throw a flood of light upon the
mythology, and elucidate many legendary uncertainties
in the theological and religious conceptions of the
Babylonians and Assyrians. Where a comparison with
royal or official cylinder-seals of certain date is not feasible,
the similarity between the style of art exhibited on
the particular seal in question and that to which some
sculptures of ancient patesis or kings conform afford us
the necessary clue, while lastly, when both of these tests
fail, if the seal bears an inscription, the character of the
writing often enables us to place it in its right class.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig49" id="fig49" />
<img src="images/fig49.jpg" width="500" height="257" alt="Fig. 49." />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49.</span></p></div>

<p>One of the earliest Babylonian rulers whose seals have
been recovered is Lugal-anda, patesi or priest-king of Lagash,
and the immediate predecessor of Urukagina, the
last king of the first dynasty of Lagash. An impression
of one of the seals of Lugal-anda is reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig49">49</a>.
Part of the seal is divided into two registers, in the uppermost
of which we see the eagle with outspread wings
<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 289</span>clutching two lions, which together formed the heraldic
arms of the city of Lagash. It is noticeable that the lions
are treated with the same freedom as on the little block
of Dudu (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig27">27</a>) the contemporary of Entemena,
one of Lugal-anda&#8217;s predecessors. Here as in the little
block referred to, the lions are treated in a very spirited
manner, and in contrast to earlier representations of the
device, the lions are gnawing at the wings of their captivator.
On the right of the city-arms there is an inscription
written in very archaic characters. In the lower
register we have two human-headed bulls, a stag, a
bearded hero resembling Izdubar, or Gilgamesh as portrayed
on other early cylinder-seals, and another figure
who is passing his left arm round the stag&#8217;s neck and
holding one of the fore-paws of the stag in his right
hand. Unlike the bearded hero, who is similarly engaged
in grasping the fore-paw of one of the human-headed
bulls, he is clean-shaven, while his hair is represented
by four tongue-shaped projections. On the left
of the two registers there is the body and the lower part
of the face of a large human-headed bull, while on the
right are two lions, one of whom is seen burying his teeth
into the neck of a composite creature, half man and half
beast. It will be at once obvious that this cylinder-seal
of the early Sumerian period, presupposes an indefinite
period of artistic development in the practice of engraving.</p>

<p><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 290</span></p>

<p>In the very early seals the scene is of course far less
composite and the workmanship infinitely more crude;
we frequently find the same eagle-motif, but the animals
which he claws are usually goats, bulls, or ibexes, as
seen in Fig. <a href="#fig50">50</a>, the lions only being introduced at a
later date. Here we have a very primitive seal in which
we see the eagle grasping two ibexes by the horns, while
a hero is grasping the same two animals by the leg.
Hero, eagle and ibexes are represented in a highly
archaic and crude fashion, though in the symmetrically
outspread wings of the eagle we seem to have a foreshadowing
of the conventionalism of later days. The
ibexes have their hind quarters raised in the air, while
the eagle grasps them by the horns, the seat of their
strength actually as well as symbolically. The seal itself
is both thicker and shorter than usual, and has only one
register.</p>

<p>But the simplicity which usually characterizes the
cylinder-seals of the earliest period sometimes gives
place to an altogether overwhelming complexity, as in
the seal represented in Fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>. The two registers into
which the field of the cylinder is divided encroach on
each other in so inordinate a manner that it requires a
careful inspection to see that there are two registers.
The eagle is the central figure in the upper register, his
claws reaching out on the one hand towards a lion attacked
by a vulture, on the other towards a lion who
appears to be attacking a reversed ibex. Below, a huntsman
occupies the commanding position; he is clad in
the short Sumerian skirt, the fringe of which is archaically
represented by a series of tags, which recall the fragmentary
sculptures of the prehistoric period of Lagash
(cf. Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, C), and he is surrounded by a crowd of lions
and antelopes. This seal is clearly the offspring of a
more developed art than that reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig50">50</a>,
but this notwithstanding, it is essentially archaic in character,
and belongs to the early Sumerian period.</p>

<p><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 291</span></p>

<p>One of the most popular designs for cylinder seals in
early Sumerian times is that of one or two seated deities,
sometimes accompanied by the eagle. A very archaic
example of this class is reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a>. The
two seated beings are certainly gods, in spite of their
being clean shaven and having the same faintly suggested
features as the figure in the middle. It will be
observed that the fringe of the short Sumerian skirt of
one of the deities and also of the worshipper is represented
by a series of pointed tags as in Fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a> we again have two seated gods, but this
time they have a large bowl between them, from which
they seem to be drinking by means of tubes. They are
apparently seated on camp-stools, while before one of
them is a sacred tree. Their dress consists in a long
robe, which covers one arm while leaving the other exposed
and free, and reaches down to the ankle, the bottom
of it being decorated with a fringe, and the body of
it by a branch-shaped design.</p>

<p>Sometimes, again, we have a representation of a god
seated in a boat as seen in Fig. <a href="#fig54">54</a>. It is impossible to say
who the god is, though his divine character is clearly
demonstrated by the horned cap. From the emergence
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 292</span>of branches, or what may be flames of fire and streams
of water from his shoulders, it seems a fair assumption
on the part of Dr. Ward that the god is none other than
Shamash, the sun-god. The boat is being propelled
through the river or canal by two oarsmen, who, together
with the god, are standing in the boat. The two men
have different head-gears, but all three are clad solely in
the old Sumerian skirt. Reeds to the height of the occupants
of the boat are growing in the water, and a very
primitively executed wild-boar is haunting this quaintly
depicted marsh. Both bow and stern of the boat are
similarly shaped, and are curved upwards to a great
height. If the god be Shamash, it seems probable that
here, as elsewhere, he is represented as traversing the
heavens in his bark.</p>

<p>Another series of archaic cylinder-seals is concerned
with the heroic feats of Gilgamesh and Ea-bani, two
mythological beings whose conquests over bulls and lions
won for them a reputation and a fame which lasted right
down to the latter days of Assyrian history. We have
an impression of one of the most primitive of the Gilgamesh
seals in Fig. <a href="#fig55">55</a>. The hero stands between two
bisons, one of which is being attacked by a lion and the
other by a leopard, while the inhuman and semi-bestial
Ea-bani is attacking the lion from behind. The occurrence
of the spotted leopard is specially noteworthy, as
it hardly ever occurs on later cylinders, while the presence
of bisons which only haunt the highlands is an
additional archaic touch, and is a further indication of
the antiquity of this seal, which must have been engraved
at a time when the recollection of his mountain origin
was still fresh in the Sumerian&#8217;s mind, for in the later
period of Babylonian art, the bison gives place to the
swamp-loving buffalo. All the details of the seal betray
the same primitive characteristics, and, as usual, there
is no inscription.</p>

<p>We have already seen one royal seal-impression, and
<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 293</span>we have in Fig. <a href="#fig56">56</a> the seal of a later but far more famous
Babylonian king, Shar-Gâni-sharri, king of Agade. In
the reign of Shar-Gâni-sharri and his son Narâm-Sin,
Babylonian art reached her climax,&#8212;the crudeness of
the earlier work had passed away, while there is as yet
no trace of the conventionalism of later days, and freedom
is the keynote of her success. The scene is an oft-recurring
one: a hero who to all appearance is Gilgamesh
is kneeling on one knee, and holds in his hands a vase,
from the overflowing streams of which the buffalo seeks
to quench his thirst. The seal is engraved with vigour
and precision, the boldness of which is only exceeded by
the natural effect produced. Both hero and animal are
treated with a freedom and fidelity seldom if ever surpassed
in Oriental art, while the strength of the picture
lies in the artist&#8217;s genius, and is in no way dependent
on the subject, which does not lend itself to anything
particularly striking or effective.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig57">57</a> we have the impression of another seal in
which Gilgamesh and Ea-bani are the prominent actors.
Ea-bani is engaged with a lion, but his comrade is fighting
with a massive horned-buffalo. This seal belongs
to the time of Shar-Gâni-sharri and Narâm-Sin, kings of
<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 294</span>Agade, its date being fixed alike by the style of art and
the purport of the brief inscription, which contains the
name of the owner, Bingani-Sharali, king of Agade and
the son of Narâm-Sin. This seal, now in the British
Museum, was discovered at Cyprus.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> The movements
of Gilgamesh and Ea-bani are portrayed in a life-like
manner, though the action of Ea-bani&#8217;s left arm is somewhat
awkward and ungraceful. The same may be said
of the overpowered and ill-designed buffalo, and also of
the antelope beneath the inscription, but the lion is decidedly
conventional, a fact possibly due to the ubiquity
of his presence on the cylinder-seals and monuments of
the earliest Sumerian times, from which one may perhaps
infer that the perpetual reproduction of the same
animal, has in time worn off the freshness with which
the artist at first approached his subject. But the Gilgamesh
seals probably reach their climax in that reproduced
in Fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>. The hero is engaged in mortal combat with
a lion, whom he is endeavouring to throw. Gilgamesh
is represented full-face and with the various peculiarities
which appear to have been proper to his unique person&#8212;the
long, curly beard, the equally long hair parted in
the centre with the three characteristic ringlets on either
side, and the body entirely naked but for a narrow girdle.
The action is concentrated and focussed into a point&#8212;there
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 295</span>are no conflicting persons, animals, or even objects
in the scene to draw away or divide the attention of the
spectator, and the animation with which the subject is
treated is ample justification for the isolated and exclusive
position that it here holds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig59" id="fig59" />

<p>Another group of Babylonian seals belonging to different
periods show the dramatic conquest of the deity over
the winged dragon. One of the earliest, best preserved,
and most instructive examples of these, is a shell cylinder
preserved in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, also
published by Ward<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig59">59</a>). The dragon has the
wings and hind part of an eagle, while his fore-legs and
head are those of a lion; between the wings upon his
back stands a nude goddess brandishing lightning in
either hand. The dragon is harnessed to a four-wheeled
chariot, the front part of which is higher than the back,
while a god of disproportionate size is driving the chariot
and flourishing a whip in his left hand. The lion-headed
dragon is apparently vomiting, and his action recalls
that of one of the expiring lions on the bas-reliefs
of Ashur-bani-pal. It may, however, be meant to represent
the ejection of venom, though if this is the case it
has not been very happily rendered. Before this group
of supernaturals, stands the worshipper who is in the
act of presenting an offering of uncertain character upon
an altar.</p>

<p><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 296</span></p>

<p>But sometimes gods and heroes are found side by side
on the same seal, as is the case on the seal reproduced in
Fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>. The horn-capped and seated deity is Shamash,
the Sun-god, from whose shoulders rays of light proceed,
while from his lap issue streams of living water.
<span class="figleft300" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig60" id="fig60">
<img src="images/fig60.jpg" width="300" height="176" alt="Fig. 60." /></a>
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span></span></span>
The god is clad in a long mantle hung from the right shoulder, while the
left arm and shoulder are left bare, and he is seated on a three or
four-legged stool. Before him is a crescent, and behind him is a star
mounted on a kind of stand, while in his presence a typical scene is
being enacted; two heroes are laying low a lion&#8212;one
of them has his left foot on the lion&#8217;s head and is grasping
the tail of the upturned beast with his left hand,
while he is about to drive a knife into its rear quarters
with his right. The other hero is holding himself in
readiness with a little hatchet; his head-gear differs from
that of his comrade in being spiked, but in all other respects
the two are alike. This seal is made of pink marble,
and is now preserved in the Metropolitan Museum,
New York. One class of deities was intimately associated
with the serpent, and a god&#8217;s body is sometimes represented
as being formed of a
<span class="figright200" style="width: 200px;"><a name="fig61" id="fig61" />
<img src="images/fig61.jpg" width="200" height="105" alt="Fig. 61." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span></span></span>
serpent coil, as is the case in the
cylinder-seal reproduced in Fig.
<a href="#fig61">61</a>. The god in this case is sitting
opposite to a goddess who is likewise
seated, and holds a shallow
cup in her hand; above her arm is the crescent, and
behind her is the mounted star as in Fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>. The star
as here represented is identical with the early Sumerian
ideogram and determinative for god, and, doubtless
has that signification here. The goddess has a long
<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297" /><span class="pagenum">Pg 297</span>robe reaching down to the ankles, but her left arm and
shoulder are free, as in the case of the god in Fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>.
Her seat consists in a kind of camp-stool, a form of
support which the genius of the Babylonian seems to
have invented at a very early date. The serpent-bodied
and human-bearded god holds a branch in his hand,
the precise significance of which is not very clear, but the
prominent place occupied by the sacred tree in Babylonian
and Assyrian mythology justifies the assumption
that here as elsewhere it has some symbolical meaning.
Behind the god is a five-barred gate, which must be intended
to suggest the difficulty of access to the divine
presence, or else the necessity of an introduction thereto.
Unless the gate were opened either by the god himself,
or by some intermediary being of divine or quasi-divine
character, the worshipper was presumably unable
to gain admittance.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, the cylinder-seals frequently
present us with the pictorial aspect of a legend already
known from the literature. One of the most famous
legends of the Babylonians was that which told of Etana&#8217;s
courageous but bootless attempt to ascend to heaven on
the wings of an eagle. Higher and higher soared the
eagle, till at last heaven&#8217;s portals were in sight, but the
goal, for some reason not indicated, was never reached,
and both Etana and his living aeroplane were dashed to
the ground. We have an illustration of this bold flight
on some of the seal-cylinders in the British Museum,
an impression of one of which is given in Fig. <a href="#fig62">62</a>.
Etana is seated on the eagle, who is bearing his burden
aloft in the sight of an admiring and upward-gazing
dog. On the right a shepherd clad in a long garment&#8212;his
right shoulder being exposed as usual&#8212;is driving
a horned sheep and two goats towards a primitive looking
fence: both Etana and the shepherd wear beards
and long hair, while the latter carries a staff in his left
hand. In the background is a naked but likewise bearded
<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 298</span>individual, who is seated beside a large amphora with
the contents of which he appears to be entirely preoccupied;
he is presumably performing culinary operations
of some kind.</p>

<p>The scene on other Babylonian seals is that of a god
attacking a humanly conceived enemy; this class comprises
cylinder-seals belonging to the archaic period as
<span class="figleft200" style="width: 200px;"><a name="fig62" id="fig62" />
<img src="images/fig62.jpg" width="200" height="103" alt="Fig. 62." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span></span></span>
well as those of later date. The
impression of one such archaic
seal is reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig63">63</a>.
In the centre we have the god,
mounted on a bull, his left hand
raised, his right hand grasping a
weapon or a whip; he is trampling on a prostrate and
suppliant foe, whose figure is sketched in the roughest
and crudest conceivable manner. As Ward says, this
seal must date from the time when the horse was unknown,
or at all events not used in battle. On the right
side of the impression, the god is engaged on foot with
an enemy who appears to be armed with a weapon
shaped like a boomerang, such as that with which the
<span class="figright300" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig63" id="fig63" />
<img src="images/fig63.jpg" width="300" height="165" alt="Fig. 63." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span></span></span>
god Nin-girsu is armed
on the Vulture Stele.
The god holds in his
right hand a weapon of
uncertain character,
while between the two
and facing the god is a
diminutive worshipper
whose hand is raised&#8212;doubtless in token of submission&#8212;towards
his divine lord. On the left the god is stabbing
a human-headed bull with a dagger, while from the
god&#8217;s back, rays, or what appear to be rays, are emitted.</p>

<p>By the time of Gudea, patesi of Lagash, and Ur-Engur
and Dungi, kings of Ur, we find a marked change in
the artistic merits of the seal-engraver&#8217;s products. Speaking
generally, they are executed with far greater care,
<a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 299</span>and with a wealth of precision entirely absent in most
of the earlier intaglios, but what they gain in care and
detailed attention, they lose in the conventionalism to
which that care and attention have given birth. We have
here no rough sketch of a born artist, but the elaborated
painting of a copyist. In Fig. <a href="#fig64">64</a> we have an impression
of one of Gudea&#8217;s cylinder-seals. The god, who is probably
Nin-girsu or Ea,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> is seated on a box-like throne:
he holds a vase in either hand, from each of which
issue two streams which pour their contents into three
vases resting on the ground, these in turn becoming
themselves the generators of living springs of water.
<span class="figright300" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig64" id="fig64" />
<img src="images/fig64.jpg" width="300" height="183" alt="Fig. 64." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span></span></span>
Facing the god is an
intermediary deity
who is supporting
one of the vases with
his left hand, and
leading the worshipper,
probably Gudea
himself, with his
right. From the
shoulders of the intermediary
emanate two serpents, the head of the near
one exactly resembling the strange reptiles on the vase
of the same patesi (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a>). The identification of
the intermediary deity with Ningish-zida is rendered
highly probable by Gudea&#8217;s allusion to this god in one
of his inscriptions, where in his description of the
manner in which he was introduced to his supreme god,
Nin-girsu, he expressly states that &#8220;Nin-gish-zi-da, his
god, held him by the hand.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.</span></p></div>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a> we have a seal-impression of Ur-Engur,
king of Ur about 2400<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span> The scene depicted is a
familiar one: an intermediary god is in the act of introducing
a suppliant worshipper to a superior deity seated
on a throne. The enthroned god has a lengthy beard
<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 300</span>and wears a round hat somewhat resembling the turban
worn by Gudea (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXII">XXIII</a>). He is resting one arm
on the back of his throne, while his right hand is extended
in apparent invitation to the slowly approaching
worshipper. The throne itself, unlike the box-like
seats of earlier days, is provided with a back, and the
back legs are fashioned after the legs of an ox. The
intermediate deities wear the horned cap with which
the gods in Gudea&#8217;s time were usually covered, while
horns appear to rise also from out of their heads, the
horns oddly enough being identical in shape with those
on the terra-cotta head discovered during the recent excavations
in Babylonia.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> The seated deity is clad in a
long simple garment reaching down to the feet, his dress
being simpler than that of the attendant deities, or even
that of the worshipper himself. The latter wears a long
tunic, and a fringed mantle over his left shoulder. Both
of the intermediaries are likewise apparelled in lengthy
garments, which differ, however, from each other and
also from that of the worshipper in being more elaborately
worked, the divine introducer wearing the richer
<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 301</span>robe of the two. The inscription refers to Ur-Engur,
king of Ur, who may conceivably be the figure seated
on the throne; in support of this theory, it is worth
noting that the kings of this dynasty were often deified
while yet on earth. Ur-Engur was succeeded by Dungi,
the impression of one of whose cylinder-seals is given
in Fig. <a href="#fig66">66</a>. Both of these seals are preserved in the
British Museum. A bearded and horn-capped god is
standing before an altar shaped like a high standing
vase, from which arises a feathered branch which may
be intended to represent the ascending flame, while two
long bare stalks with tufted heads hang over the altar
on either side. The god holds in his left hand a weapon,
the upper end of which is provided with a lateral semicircular
handle, similar to that found at Tellô by De
Sarzec, and also to that represented on the stone vase
of Gudea (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a>). In his extended right hand he
holds a three-stalked flower, which is an exact replica
of that found in the hands of mythical beings on later
Assyrian bas-reliefs. On the other side of the altar
is the suppliant, clad in the same fringed garment seen
in Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>, while his right hand is raised in adoration.
Behind him is another worshipper whose dress resembles
that of the god, and who is similarly crowned
with a horned cap, but in spite of this divine distinction
he has both hands raised in worship. Dungi
was succeeded by Bur-Sin, one of whose cylinder-seals
<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 302</span>is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig67">67</a>. The scene varies little from that
found on the seals of his predecessors. A seated god,
a worshipper, and another adoring figure wearing a
divine head-gear behind. The god wears a turban as
in the seal of Ur-Engur (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>); he reposes on
a very thickly upholstered seat, while both his own
feet and those of his throne rest on a small low platform.
The worshipper here has his hands clasped in
front in much the same way as Gudea&#8217;s hands are, in
the statues from Tellô, but the third figure, whom Ward
somewhat humorously describes as a &#8220;flounced goddess,&#8221;
has both hands raised. An impression of a
cylinder-seal of Gimil-Sin, the successor of Bur-Sin on
the throne of Ur, is reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig68">68</a>. The turbaned
and long-bearded god is again seated on a richly
upholstered divan, and is elevated on a little platform.
He holds in his right hand a double-handled vase, while
his left hand is concealed in the folds of his flounced
robe. The garment of the intermediary is exactly the
same as that of the seated god, but a horned cap takes
the place of the turban. The worshipper behind has one
hand raised like his usher, while the fringed garment
hanging from his shoulder is arranged so as to allow
his left leg to be seen. A seal of Ibi-Sin, the last of the
dynasty (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig69">69</a>) presents the same subject, while
the treatment practically shows no variation. It will
have been noticed that the star and crescent find a place
on some of these cylinders, while from others they are
absent,&#8212;from which it may reasonably be inferred that
they were mere symbolic accessories, and as such of no
vital importance.</p>

<p>All these seals bear inscriptions in contradistinction to
those belonging to the earlier period, and a considerable
part of the field of the cylinder is occupied with writing
instead of scenery. But as time went on this tendency
became more pronounced, and during the Kassite period,
sometimes nearly the whole of the seal is occupied with
<a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 303</span>an inscription, usually of a religious character. Thus on
a cylinder inscribed with the name of Kurigalzu, the
Kassite king of Babylonia (<i>circ.</i> 1400<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>) (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a>) the
pictorial element is reduced to one single figure, that of
the worshipper.</p>

<p>An extremely interesting seal-impression of the Kassite
period is published by Clay in <i>The Museum Journal</i>,
University of Pennsylvania (I, 1910, pp. 4-6). It is
dated in the fourth year of Nazi-Maruttash, king of
Babylon (<i>circ.</i> 1330<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>) (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a>). Three bearded men
are engaged in ploughing; one is urging on the two
humped oxen who are yoked to the ploughshare, the
second holds the handles, while the third appears to be
pouring grain into a drill attached to the plough.</p>

<p>It has been said that this seal-impression gives us the
earliest representation of the Babylonian plough, but
that statement must be considerably modified in the light
of the early seal-impressions given by Ward (p. 132,
Figs. 369, 371, 372). The plough is portrayed on all
these three cylinders, and they all antedate the cylinder-seal
<a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 304</span>of Nazi-Maruttash (cf. also the votive-tablet from
Nippur, Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, E).</p>

<p>The Neo-Babylonian Empire (625-538<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>) inherited
the stereotyped traditions of the long period of Kassite
<span class="figleft300" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig71" id="fig71" />
<img src="images/fig71.jpg" width="300" height="136" alt="Fig. 71." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span></span></span>
supremacy, and though
there was a certain reaction
in favour of the
pictorial as against the
literary element in the
later cylinder-seals, the
style of art remained
more or less unchanged, if not unchangeable. A good
example of a Neo-Babylonian seal-impression is that found
on a tablet dated in the 26th year of Nebuchadnezzar (cf.
Fig. <a href="#fig72">72</a>).<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> The worshipper stands before a rectangular
box which looks like an altar, but which, according to
Ward, is the seat of the gods. It supports two emblems,
one a dog and the other a thunderbolt of the storm-god
Adad. The posture, attitude and general appearance of
the worshipper exactly correspond to those found on the
Kassite cylinders of Kurigalzu (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a>), and are a
good illustration of the conventionalism to which later
Mesopotamian art became so hopelessly enslaved.</p>

<p>The cylinder-seal was employed in Assyria from the
earliest periods of her history,
<span class="figright300" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig72" id="fig72" />
<img src="images/fig72.jpg" width="300" height="156" alt="Fig. 72." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span></span></span>
and continued to be
used right down to the
time of the Persians, who
in turn adopted the same
kind of seal. A cylinder-seal
belonging to the early
Assyrian period, i.e. about 2000<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>, is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig73">73</a>.
The workmanship is crude, but in the scene itself we see
in embryo the military exploits of the late Assyrian bas-reliefs.
A warrior, mounted in his two-wheeled war-chariot,
is in the act of dispatching an arrow from his
<a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 305</span>drawn bow; his rival, on foot, is doing exactly the same,
and it appears to be a question as to which of the two
combatants will get his arrow in first. The chariot is
drawn by a bull, an indication that the horse was not as
yet used for war purposes, while the four-spoked wheels
<span class="figright200" style="width: 200px;"><a name="fig73" id="fig73" />
<img src="images/fig73.jpg" width="200" height="119" alt="Fig. 73." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 73.</span></span></span>
are a further archaic touch&#8212;the
chariot-wheels of the later Assyrians
having eight, twelve, or
sometimes sixteen spokes. The
bull, in his mad career, is trampling
over a prostrate foe, a scene
which is frequently represented
on the bas-reliefs; it is however interesting to see the
symbolical star and crescent of the old Babylonians reproduced
on this early Assyrian seal.</p>

<p>We have already seen the winged-dragon on an archaic
Babylonian seal (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig59">59</a>), but it was apparently not
till the Assyrian era that the conflict between &#8220;Bel and
the dragon&#8221; was represented in Mesopotamian art.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>
<span class="figleft200" style="width: 200px;"><a name="fig74" id="fig74" />

<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span></span></span>
On an early Assyrian cylinder-seal,
now preserved in the
Metropolitan Museum, New
York (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig74">74</a>), we have a
primitive picture of the conquest
of Bel-Merodach as the representative
and very incarnation
of order, system and method, over the dragon&#8212;the
personification of disorder and tumultuous chaos.
The god is drawing his bow&#8212;not apparently at a
venture, but with the deadly certainty with which
the gods can presumably aim. This notwithstanding,
the god has taken the precaution of carrying a
quiver-full of arrows on his back, while he is further
armed with an axe. The winged-dragon of composite
character is reared upon his hind legs, his face
turned towards his omnipotent adversary, as on the
<a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 306</span>famous Marduk and Tiâmat bas-relief. The god
is accompanied by another beast with wings, who is
doubtless ready to come to the assistance of his divine
lord when called upon. Behind the god we see the
winged disc, and what appear to be two eyes, while the
<span class="figleft250" style="width: 250px;"><a name="fig75" id="fig75" />
<img src="images/fig75.jpg" width="250" height="195" alt="Fig. 75." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span></span></span>
crescent of Sin, the moon-god,
and the star of Ishtar are
engraved in front. Behind
the dragon is a sacred tree,
resembling a palm-tree. The
sacred tree played a very important
part in Assyrian art,
and is one of the most frequently
recurring objects on
the palace-wall reliefs. It is likewise often to be
found on Assyrian seals, a good example of which is
afforded by a cylinder-seal in the British Museum
reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig75">75</a>. The sacred tree in its most
conventionalized form occupies the central part of
the picture; on either side stands the king with hand
raised in adoration; his dress&#8212;for an Assyrian king&#8212;is
comparatively simple, but his head-gear is a replica
of the pointed hat so frequently seen upon the
heads of Assyrian kings on the palace wall-reliefs.

Above the sacred tree is the god
Ashur with his winged disc, from
which two cords descend which
seem to form the outward connecting
link between the god and
his worshipper, and recall the
rays which emanate from the disc
of Aten, and terminate in hands bearing the Egyptian
symbol of life, on the famous stele of Khuenaten, the
so-called &#8220;heretic king&#8221; of the eighteenth dynasty of
Egypt. Behind the king is the winged eagle-headed
genius so constantly represented on the bas-reliefs.
This strange mythical creature has one hand raised
<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 307</span>while in the other he carries a basket of the ordinary
Assyrian type.</p>

<p>In a number of seals, one of which is reproduced here
(cf. Fig. <a href="#fig76">76</a>), a man-fish, or a fish-god, resembling the
figure found by Layard in sculptured relief at Nimrûd
(cf. Pl. <a href="#pIV">IV</a>) occupies the most prominent position.
Ashur in his winged disc is again casting the shadow
of his divine protection over the sacred tree; on either
side stands the Dagan-like worshipper with one hand
raised and holding a basket in the other. He is followed
by an attendant worshipper, while behind, is a warlike-looking
personage&#8212;possibly the god Marduk&#8212;who is
<span class="figright350" style="width: 350px;"><a name="fig77" id="fig77" />
<img src="images/fig77.jpg" width="350" height="199" alt="Fig. 77." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span></span></span>
about to execute vengeance
on an ostrich;
with his left hand he
firmly grasps the ostrich&#8217;s
long neck, and
in his right he holds a
scimitar with which
he apparently intends
to remove the
bird&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>The seated deity found on Babylonian seals of all
periods is also found on the cylinder-seals of the Assyrians.
We have a good specimen of an Assyrian seal
of the kind referred to in Fig. <a href="#fig77">77</a>. A bearded god is
seated on a chair with a high back such as is never
found on Babylonian cylinders: the legs of the chair
are strengthened to support the weighty person of the
divine occupant by means of cross-bars, while the back
is somewhat grotesquely decorated with balls. In front
of the god is a table or stand with double folding legs
and covered with a cloth upon which a shallow bowl and
two flat cakes of bread are set; above the table is a fish&#8212;its
head turned towards the god. Behind the enthroned
god stands a goddess, from whose body proceed four ray-like
projections which terminate in stars, the general appearance
<a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 308</span>of the projections being not unlike that of four
starry rockets. Before the loaded table stands the worshipper
with one hand raised, while in the field of the
cylinder there is an ibex, an eye-shaped design, seven
balls and a crescent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X&#8212;SHELL-ENGRAVING AND
IVORY-WORK</h2>

<h3>(<i>A</i>) SHELL-ENGRAVING</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE art of engraving on shell in Mesopotamia dates
back to the earliest days of Sumerian civilization.
The most ancient of these engravings are executed on
shells with rough surfaces, of which those of the oyster
seem to have been the most popular.</p>

<p>Some of the fragments recovered are clearly shaped
and fashioned for inlaying purposes, while others, of
curved shape, can be fitted together and once formed
part of an engraved and delicately moulded vase or
cup. Some time later mother-of-pearl became the popular
material among engravers, who used it to great
advantage. Mother-of-pearl is undoubtedly more effective
and striking than ordinary shell, but it has its
disadvantages and drawbacks, for it is both brittle and
scaly, and in consequence of this the engraver seems to
have been compelled from the necessity of the case to
confine himself to the use of flat blades or flakes when
employing this material.</p>

<p>One of the most ancient specimens of the shell-engraver&#8217;s
art as yet discovered is that reproduced in
Fig. <a href="#fig78">78</a>. This fragment is convex in form and a truncated
triangle as regards its shape. A lion is seen in
the act of strangling a bull; with one of his fore-legs
he is grasping his victim round the neck, and the other
is thrown around and over the bull&#8217;s back, while he
is burying his teeth in the bull&#8217;s neck. The general
style to which this engraving conforms, the full-face
view of the lion, the act in which he is engaged, and
<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 310</span>the combined vigour and crudeness which characterize
this production, vividly recall the mace-head of Mesilim,
king of Kish (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig26">26</a>). The comparison
between the two is so striking that we can hardly be
wrong in assigning this engraved shell to approximately
the same period, i.e. to the time before Ur-Ninâ, the
founder of the first dynasty of Lagash. It was discovered
at Tellô in the neighbourhood of Eannatum&#8217;s
well and is just under three inches in height. In Fig.
<a href="#fig79">79</a><a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> we have another fragment of a very archaic shell-engraving;
a human-headed and streaky-bearded bull is
being attacked by a lion-headed eagle; the shell itself is
extremely thin, and the engraving very delicate, but the
design itself as well as the mode of its execution both
testify to its great age. The shell work of the time of
Ur-Ninâ and his successors is well illustrated in Fig.
<a href="#fig80">80</a>. We have here a sketch of a man bearing a net;
the man is clean-shaven and bald, and his face is of precisely
the same type as that so frequently represented
on the sculptures of Ur-Ninâ&#8217;s time. His only clothing
is a short &#8220;kaunakes&#8221; skirt, the fringe of which
is portrayed in the fashion characteristic of the earliest
Sumerian works of art. In his right hand he carries a
<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 311</span>battle-axe, while with his left he holds the ends of two sticks
from which is slung the net or basket already referred
to. This small relic was found in the same neighbourhood
as the preceding, and is just under two inches
high. Another interesting specimen of Sumerian shell-engraving
is published by Mr. L. W. King in the
<i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archæology</i>, 1910,
pp. 243-5. It represents a bearded hero embracing an
ibex. It is worthy of note that the hero&#8217;s dress does
not consist in the Sumerian skirt, but in a loin-cloth.
Probably the finest example of early Babylonian shell-work
is that reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig81">81</a>; the leaping kid is
wonderfully realistic both in form and attitude and has
clearly been studied from nature. Of the mother-of-pearl
work of a somewhat later date we have a good example
in Fig. <a href="#fig82">82</a>. Here Gilgamesh is depicted in standing
posture holding in either hand one of the long
&#8220;staves&#8221; seen elsewhere, and specifically on the famous
green steatite vase of Gudea (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a>). Gilgamesh is
portrayed full-face and has the long vertically streaked
beard so frequently seen on the cylinder-seals. This fragment
is just under two and a half inches in height, and
emanated from the same place. The engraved oblong
mother-of-pearl plaques would appear to have been used
for the decoration of the handles of knives or daggers.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig83">83</a> we have one of the best preserved and most
interesting specimens of later shell-work in Mesopotamia.
This fragment was discovered at Warka (Erech),
but is clearly Assyrian in style: the elaborately caparisoned
horses remind us strikingly of the horses sculptured
in relief on the palace walls of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal at
Nimrûd (Calah), while the floral decoration betrays
Egyptian influence and recalls the carved ivories which
were found amid the débris of that king&#8217;s palace. The
ruined mounds of Assyria herself have yielded but few
specimens of the shell-engraver&#8217;s art, and those that have
<span class="figleft400" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig83" id="fig83" />

<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 83.</span> (After Layard.)</span></span>
been recovered
are for the most
part Ph&#339;nician
in workmanship
and Egyptian
in conception,
sphinxes and lotus-plants
assuming
the most
prominent part
in the decoration.
The discovery
of engraved
shells of apparently a yet later date was among
the many interesting results attending the German excavations
at Babylon; a number of these shells were found
on the floor of a building of Nebuchadnezzar, some of
which showed Egyptian influence and were decorated
with lotus ornaments. Shell was thus used for various
decorative purposes, but in early times it sometimes
served as a material for the fashioning of even so utilitarian
an object as a seal, as we have already had occasion
to remark.</p>

<h3>(<i>B</i>) IVORY-WORK</h3>

<p>Unlike shell, which could be readily picked up on
the shores of the Persian Gulf by the inhabitants of
<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 313</span>the earliest centres of civilization in Lower Mesopotamia,
many of which were doubtless seaports in those
days, ivory was only procurable elsewhere, and it was not
till the dwellers in the valley extended their power outside
that they were able to command a supply of this
more precious substance, ivory forming one of the principal
materials exacted by the later Assyrian kings from
their various vassal princes. A large collection of carved
ivories discovered in Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal&#8217;s palace at Nimrûd
(Calah) affords us the desired opportunity for studying
the ivory work of the period, and for ascertaining
the proficiency to which that art was brought by the
artists of that day. What strikes one instantly, and with
overwhelming force, about the little group of carved
<span class="figleft200" style="width: 200px;"><a name="fig84" id="fig84" />
<img src="images/fig84.jpg" width="200" height="436" alt="Fig. 84." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 84.</span></span></span>
ivories in Pl. <a href="#pXXXII">XXXII</a> is their pronounced Egyptian
appearance, a sure and certain indication of the intimate
relation which must have subsisted between Egypt and
Assyria at this period. In the top right-hand corner
we have the head of a woman, represented full-face and
with an Egyptian head-gear: the head is set within the
frame of a narrow window, from which it looks out over
a balcony supported by pillars. In the centre we have
the fragment of a similar head, below which there is a
bull&#8217;s head. In the top left-hand corner we have an ivory
plaque upon which is figured an Egyptian king in standing
posture, grasping a lotus plant about his own height
with his left hand. The plant rests upon a stand, the
top of which is shaped volute-wise and resembles the
capitals of the columns on the bas-relief from Sippar
(cf. Pl. <a href="#pXIVa">XIV</a>). Below on the left is a carved ivory sphinx,
which in style and character is clearly neither Assyrian
nor Babylonian. But the most interesting specimen in
this group is the carved ivory panel in which two women
are seated opposite each other on either side of a cartouche
surmounted by a disc and feathers. The cartouche contains
Egyptian hieroglyphs which may be read &#8220;Uben
Shu,&#8221; the meaning of which would be &#8220;The Sun god
<a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 314</span>riseth,&#8221; or the &#8220;Rising Sun&#8221;: the inside of this cartouche
is gilded, and the characters within are inlaid.
The feathers, which are likewise inlaid, are the emblem
of Maat, the god of truth, and the disc is of course emblematic
of the sun. The two women are obviously
Egyptian, their head-dresses, the folds in their garments
and their general attitude all alike
testifying to their Egyptian origin,
while beneath their seats, which
consist of low-backed chairs, there
is the &#8220;ankh&#8221; sign, the meaning
of which is &#8220;life.&#8221; This sign, misnamed
&#8220;crux ansata,&#8221; or &#8220;cross
with a handle,&#8221; has needless to say
nothing whatsoever to do with the
Christian symbol; it probably represented
a girdle, that which
used to be regarded as a handle
being that part of the girdle which
encircled the waist, the long stem
being the loose ends, and a girdle
as encircling the vital parts would
not unnaturally symbolize life,
and in picture-language come to
signify it. The two seated figures
have one hand raised in token of
adoration before the sacred emblems
in the middle, while in their
other hands they firmly grasp a sceptre. Below we have
seven more fragmentary specimens of ivory-work, all of
which were discovered amid the ruins of the same palace
and betray a strong foreign influence. The deductions
which these little ivory carvings justify our making
in regard to the foreign affairs of Assyria at this
period, are rendered certainties by the evidence afforded
by the bronze bowls dealt with in the chapter on
Metallurgy.</p>

<p>It must not however be supposed that all the ivories
discovered in Assyria are the work of Egyptian or
Ph&#339;nician artists. Some, of which a good specimen is
seen in Fig. <a href="#fig84">84</a>, are as Assyrian in style and conception
as any palace bas-relief. The ivory panel here reproduced
is just five inches high. The subject is a familiar
one&#8212;a four-winged mythological being crowned with
a horned cap, with the right hand extended in the performance
of some religious ceremony, and carrying a
basket in the left hand. Not only is the motif entirely
Assyrian in character, but the workmanship and manner
of execution bears the unmistakable hall-mark of
Assyria. The aggressive masculinity of the arms and
legs, the folds, arrangement and style of the garments
as well as the hair and strongly depicted beard, are all
exactly paralleled in the figures so often seen on the
stone sculptures of the period. On either side of the
panel in which this mythological creature is enshrined
there is a scroll-work device which was employed in
Babylonia as early at all events as the time of Entemena
of Lagash, while his feet stand upon a line of the rosettes
which appear so frequently as a decorative accessory in
Assyrian works of art. The lower part of this panel is
filled in with circular and volute-shaped devices, and at
the bottom of all we have another line of rosettes.
Among the various subjects carved on the other ivory
panels emanating from the ruins of the same palace the
following may be mentioned as of especial interest: a
hero slaying a lion, some Assyrians gathering fruit,
and Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal accompanied by deities and attendants.</p>

<p>These ivory panels from Nimrûd were as we have
seen, in many cases inlaid<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> with lapis lazuli and gilded,
and they were probably used to decorate and embellish
thrones, or other stately articles of furniture, and in
<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 316</span>this connection we not unnaturally think of the great
throne which Solomon built for himself, which is said
to have been made of ivory and overlaid with the best
gold (cf. 1 Kings x. 18) as also of the ivory palace
erected by Ahab.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI&#8212;TERRA-COTTA FIGURES
AND RELIEFS</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T were indeed paradoxical if the Babylonian artists
had not invoked the aid of the clay, which they
employed so readily and extensively not only in their
building operations but also for all ordinary writing
purposes, in their attempts to represent human and
animal life. Undoubtedly this material was not employed
for these purposes so frequently as might have
been expected, but this is probably due to the comparative
fragility of this substance and its consequent inability
to withstand the disintegrating effects of time
and climate; as most of the objects fashioned by Babylonian
artists would appear to be of a votive character,
it is obvious that durability was one of the most important
considerations in their production. Notwithstanding
this fact however, a sufficiently large number of
terra-cotta figures, some of which belong to the earliest
periods of Sumerian civilization, have fortunately been
preserved. The most ancient of these terra-cotta models
are extremely small in size and crude in workmanship.
We have a very archaic example in Fig. <a href="#fig85">85</a>, A. The
eyes of this small figure are the most noticeable features;
they consist of flattened balls; the bodies of these
primitive little models are as unfinished as they can be,
sometimes being fashioned merely triangular-wise. In
Fig. <a href="#fig85">85</a>, B, we have another example of the same type
and belonging to the same period, though it shows a
slight advancement on the preceding figure. A thick
head-gear or wig, crowns the head, and in its hands it
holds an object of uncertain character, either a child or
<a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 318</span>an instrument of music according to M. Heuzey. The
clay, though moulded in the hand, is incised with a
number of delicate lines, which are probably due to the
application of a sharp and finely pointed tool. These
curious figures are about one and a half or two inches
high.</p>

<p>The next illustration (Fig. <a href="#fig85">85</a>, C.) transfers us from
the early Sumerian period to that of Gudea. The comparative
proficiency attained through long cultivation
of the art is sufficiently obvious. The figure is that of
a god, his head-gear being characteristically furnished
with four pairs of horns, and unlike the copper votive
statuettes of Gudea the god here has bull&#8217;s ears. The
upper part of the body is left bare, but the lower part,
which unfortunately is not preserved, was evidently
covered by a garment fastened round the waist by a
girdle. The god&#8217;s left hand has hold of a stick or
weapon inserted in the girdle, the upper portion of
which is seen in the illustration. As usual, the god
wears a heavy beard represented by a series of vertical
streaks, but the arrangement of his hair in two long
tails hanging down over his chest and curled at the ends,
is somewhat peculiar. This little plaque is between two
and a half and three inches in height.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig85" id="fig85" />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 85.</span>&#8212;A, B (cf. <i>Déc. en Chald.</i>, Pl. 39; 1, 2). C (cf. Cat., Fig. 183).<br />
D (cf. Cat., Fig. 193; <i>Déc. en Chald.</i>, p. 252). (All Musée du Louvre.)</p></div>

<p>The Sumerians of early times did not however confine
themselves to a portrayal of single figures in their
clay reliefs, but sometimes aspired to complete scenes;
<a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 319</span>thus in the fragment reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig85">85</a>, D, we see a
standing woman; her hands are raised in a devotional
manner, and doubtless were the remainder of this clay
relief preserved we should see her accompanied by her
husband, as so frequently on the cylinder-seals. Her
thick, wavy hair hangs plait-wise down her back, and a
raised fillet surrounds her head. The relief in which the
woman&#8217;s figure is raised is high, and the workmanship,
though crude is not without life. This little fragment is
about five inches high and is made of grey-coloured clay.
Occasionally these terra-cotta figures were painted, as
was the case with the little male statuettes discovered at
Babylon in 1910.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>Ever faithful in the art of imitation, the Assyrians
also turned their attention to the artistic possibilities inherent
in the clay which they used alike for the construction
of their houses and for writing purposes. Some of
the clay figures, or little clay reliefs discovered in Assyria
belong without doubt to Assyrian times, but by far the
larger half of the terra-cotta figures, lamps and other
objects discovered are as certainly post-Assyrian.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig86" id="fig86" />

<p>Some very interesting terra-cotta figures representing
the Fish-god, Dagan, are preserved in the British
Museum (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig86">86</a>, A, B). These small images are
only a few inches high, but the humanly conceived face
of the god is treated with less conventionalism than is
the case with the sculptured portraits of human beings
during the Assyrian period, a fact which of course may
possibly be due to the plasticity of clay as compared with
stone. These little figures are probably Assyrian and
not Babylonian in workmanship; at all events, a fish-god
sculptured in relief was discovered at the entrance
to a small Assyrian temple at Nimrûd, which, apart from
other evidence,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> is a clear indication that the fish-god was
venerated in Assyria as well as in Babylonia. It would
<a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 320</span>seem reasonable to suppose that the Dagan-cult would
naturally find its origin in the alluvial centres of Sumerian
civilization in the extreme south of Babylonia,
<a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 321</span>where the water was an all-important factor for good or
ill, but according to Jastrow<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> it was imported from the
north to the south, though the name of a king of Isin,
Ishme-Dagan, who reigned about 2200<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>, shows that
the god was known and revered in Babylonia at least as
early as his time. On the other hand it is equally
noteworthy that one of the earliest known Assyrian
kings, whose reign must probably be assigned to the
nineteenth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, also bore that name. These
clay images of the gods were usually buried as amulets
in the foundations of buildings. Another terra-cotta
image of a god belonging to the Assyrian period, and
the work of an Assyrian artist, is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig86">86</a>, C.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> This
little image was found, together with two other terra-cotta
figures, beneath the floor of the court of Sargon&#8217;s
palace at Khorsabad. Each had been enclosed in a brick
capsule as a foundation-amulet, where they remained
undisturbed until the spade of Botta brought them once
more to light. The figure here reproduced is that of
an Assyrian god, while one of the other two was a mythical
creature, and the third was a demon, but all three
must have been buried for much the same purpose, the
god to take care of the positive welfare of the inmates
of the palace, the demon to act negatively in warding off
evil influences, while they all have their stone counterparts
in the bas-reliefs recovered from the ruins of Assyrian
palaces. This little image is eight inches high and
is made of a greyish clay. The god is clothed in a long
robe reaching down to his feet; his head is crowned
with a cap encircled by two pairs of horns, and his beard
conforms to the usual Assyrian type.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>Various terra-cotta figures of nude women or goddesses
have been recovered from different Babylonian
<a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 322</span>and Assyrian sites, but they are for the most part not
earlier than the Parthian period, and their consideration
does not therefore fall within the scope of the
present volume. There are however exceptions to this
generalization, one of the most remarkable being that
of a terra-cotta figure also preserved in the Louvre and
reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig86">86</a>, E.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> This little model is reported
to have been found at Hillah, near Babylon; the place
of its discovery was a Greek grave, but it was found in
the company of seals and amulets belonging to a much
earlier period. The woman, in a standing position, is
seen suckling her infant at her breast. The bodies of
the mother and her child both exhibit the characteristic
fullness of Eastern art, but in spite of this fact, there
is a delicacy and refinement, as well as an insight into
the charms of human nature such as is seldom seen in
the statues and figures of Oriental antiquity. Various
terra-cotta figures of nude women were also discovered at
Nippur in the strata of Shar-Gâni-sharri and Ur-Engur,
while another interesting example of a nude woman or
goddess is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig86">86</a>, D.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> This little clay figure
was discovered during the course of the German excavations
at Babylon, a site which has yielded numerous terra-cotta
figures of nude women with and without a child;
the lower part of the body does not apparently belong to
the upper part represented here, but is the broken half
of another clay figure; it enables us however to form a
better idea of the general appearance of these terra-cottas
when complete. Both fragments were recovered
in the ruins of the temple of the goddess Nin-Makh,
and doubtless formed part of clay miniatures of a stone
statue of the goddess, which unfortunately has not yet
been brought to light. The figure exhibits a certain
heaviness, which the thick tresses of hair only tend to
accentuate. The hair itself appears to be carefully waved
<a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 323</span>and curled; the woman&#8217;s hands are clasped below her
breasts, while she wears bracelets on her wrists and
anklets on her legs.</p>

<p>During the same excavations an interesting figure
of a bearded man, made of unbaked clay and measuring
about six inches high, was found in the temple of
Adar; his left arm is hanging down, and his right arm
is extended and holds what appears to be a staff, while
on his head he wears a Phrygian cap or something akin.
A similar clay figure was found in the Anu-Adad temple,
but it differed from the former in being provided with a
golden staff. The figure was enclosed in what is known
as a brick
capsule;
these capsules
were
sometimes
only a few
inches high,
but at other
times reached
as much
as twenty inches. These capsuled statuettes were generally
located before the entrances to rooms. Sometimes
figures of animals as well as of human beings were
similarly enshrined in brick capsules; thus a model of
a clay dove enclosed in this manner was discovered by
the German excavators at Babylon.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting of the Assyrian terra-cotta
models must be mentioned those of the favourite
hunting-dogs of Ashur-bani-pal (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig87">87</a>) found in his
palace at Nineveh; these same dogs can however be so
much more readily studied from the stone bas-reliefs of
this same king, that it will be best to forgo any detailed
consideration of them here. Unfortunately it is impossible
to speak with any confidence as regards the date of
the vast majority of clay figures yielded by the excavations
<a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 324</span>in Babylonia and Assyria; they comprise figures
of gods and goddesses, as well as of dogs, lions and other
animals. Some of these are fashioned in the round,
others are portrayed in relief upon small plaques. One
of the best preserved of these plaques is reproduced in
Fig. <a href="#fig88">88</a>. This little clay relief was discovered by Sir
Henry Rawlinson at Birs-Nimrûd. A clean-shaven
and semi-nude attendant is in charge of a large hound
which he is leading by means of a strap. The attendant,
who is armed with a stick, is more life-like than
the attendants on the bas-reliefs of Ashur-bani-pal,
but the dog, though spirited, cannot compare with
those sculptured in hard stone on the palace walls
of that same king. The innumerable terra-cotta lamps
which have been excavated from time to time for
the most part belong to a late period, it is however interesting
to note that clay lamps were apparently in use at
a very early period, even as early as the time of Bur-Sin,
king of Ur (<i>circ.</i> 2350<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>), one of whose clay lamps was
discovered at Nippur. We have already remarked that
clay was probably used extensively for making moulds
for casting metal objects, and it is certain that it was
sometimes used by the sculptor as a material for rough
sketches (cf. p. <a href="#Page_118">118</a>). The clay figures or statuettes of
the earlier period were either fashioned by hand, or else
stamped in a mould, but in either case they were solid,
in contradistinction to the Babylonian terra-cottas of
the later Greek and Roman times which were generally
hollow in the interior, their outside being coated with a
kind of paste by means of which the artist endeavoured
to work out the details of hair, clothing, and other externalities,
while they were not infrequently covered
with a vitreous glaze, the colours used being blue and
green. But a consideration of this later work lies beyond
the scope of our volume, which is confined to a
consideration of the Babylonian and Assyrian period.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII&#8212;STONEWARE AND
POTTERY</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>TONE and clay were the two materials from which
the Babylonians and Assyrians as a rule manufactured
their vases, pots and bowls, though, as we have
seen (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>), metal was occasionally used for the purpose.
Unfortunately the study of Babylonian and Assyrian
pottery has never received the attention which it
deserves, while in the earlier excavations carried on in
Mesopotamia the importance of these uninscribed relics
of the past was not realized, and the omission to observe
the particular strata of the mounds in which they were
respectively discovered, as well as in some cases the
failure to note even the sites where they were unearthed,
has made anything like a systematic study of Babylonian
and Assyrian pottery a virtual impossibility.</p>

<p>Various kinds of stone were used as materials for
making bowls and vases from the earliest periods of
Mesopotamian civilization. Thus at Nippur the American
excavators unearthed a vase made of sandstone,
bearing an inscription of Utug, patesi or priest-king of
Kish, the writing of which was even more archaic than
that on the mace-head of Mesilim, king of Kish (cf. p.
185, Fig. <a href="#fig26">26</a>) and, therefore, presumably of an earlier
date; it seems to have been dedicated to En-lil as a
thank-offering, an incidental testimony to the important
place which the god of Nippur must have occupied even
at this extremely remote period. So, too, a vase of white
calcite stalagmite, bearing an inscription of Urzage, a
king of Kish belonging to about the same period, was
dedicated to En-lil and his spouse Nin-lil.</p>

<p><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 326</span></p>

<p>Stone vases have similarly been found at Tellô, while
the fragments of a number of stone vases made of white
calcite stalagmite and bearing an inscription of Lugal-zaggisi,
the king of Umma who sacked Lagash in the
reign of Urukagina the last king of the first dynasty,
were found on the same site, and we learn from the inscriptions
on these vase-fragments that they were dedicated
by Lugal-zaggisi to En-lil at E-kur. A fragment
of an alabaster vase bearing the name of Urukagina is
now preserved in the British Museum, and an onyx
vase, dedicated to the goddess Bau, was discovered in
the neighbourhood of Ur-Ninâ&#8217;s building, while a large
basalt bowl of Eannatum was found on the same site, and
the fragments of a limestone vase, bearing an inscription
of Entemena, a later king of Lagash, were discovered
beneath the temple of En-lil at Nippur. So also at
Jôkha, the site of the ancient city of Umma, fragments
of vases and objects made of stone were brought to light,
while at Fâra, the ruined mounds of which represent one
of the earliest sites of Sumerian civilization in the Babylonian
plain, vases and cups made of various stones including
marble were recovered. These were generally
of a simple character, though sometimes they were
decorated. But Bismâya, thanks to the scientific excavations
carried on by Harper and Banks for the University
of Chicago, has probably yielded a richer and
more varied harvest of stone pots than any other site in
Babylonia. They comprise bowls, phials, dishes, cups,
mugs, and vessels of every conceivable shape, the tallest
measuring about twelve inches in height, and the largest
about twelve inches in diameter, while the thickness of
the walls varies from an eighth of an inch to just under
an inch and a quarter.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> The stones from which they are
made vary almost as much as their dimensions, and include
white marble, yellow marble, alabaster, yellow
limestone, pinkish onyx, porphyry, green porphyry, blue
<a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 327</span>freestone, soft limestone, and grey sandstone. Hardly
any of these manifold vessels were found complete, but
Banks was able to reconstruct a large number from the
fragments that remained. They were all polished; some
were engraved with a comparatively simple design, while
others were elaborately decorated with the figures of men
and animals, and some were inlaid with ivory and precious
stones. The inscriptions were few and fragmentary,
the name of the king or the temple mentioned
being otherwise unknown, while the writing is extremely
archaic. That part of the mound in which these stone
vase fragments were discovered contains only the plano-convex
bricks characteristic of the old Sumerian period,
which further indicates the extreme antiquity of this large
collection of stone-ware, and indeed stone-ware seems to
have been to a great extent supplanted by the more economical
and more easily wrought clay pottery, at a comparatively
early date, as was the case in ancient Egypt. Most
of the vases from Bismâya are circular in shape, though
examples of oval, oblong, square, and shell-shaped vases
were also found. The stone most commonly used was
marble, due no doubt to its comparative softness and
adaptability to the chisel. The curvature and general
symmetry of these vases is so perfect that, according to
Banks, a lathe or something answering the same purpose
as a lathe, must have been used. The softer stones at this
period were doubtless worked with flint instruments, as
in the case of the earliest cylinder-seals. The purposes
which these vases served must have been as diversified
as the vases themselves. Some appear to have been
lamps, others drinking-cups; some were probably used as
water, wine, or oil jars, while others may have been used
as wash-basins; some were used for articles of toilet, and
in one vessel traces of <i>henna</i><a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> were still visible in one
compartment and traces of <i>kohl</i> in the other.</p>

<p>Of the stone-ware of the early period of Semitic
<a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 328</span>supremacy in the Euphrates valley, a gracefully curved
vase of white marble belonging to Urumush<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> king of
Kish, which was discovered at Nippur during the course
of the excavations carried on by the University of Pennsylvania,
and is now preserved in the Pennsylvania
Museum, affords us a good example; while of the stone-ware
of the somewhat later period of Shar-Gâni-sharri
and Narâm-Sin, the Semitic kings of Agade, a white alabaster
&#8220;phial&#8221; (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig89">89</a>) discovered at Tellô and
bearing the name of Narâm-Sin is an excellent specimen.
It consists in a well-rounded flask or phial seven and
a half inches high, and is inscribed with the words
&#8220;Narâm-Sin, King of the four regions.&#8221; Another small
stone vase of this king made of marble was acquired by
Oppert during the ill-fated expedition of 1855, the inscription
upon which gave the additional information
that the stone from which the vase was made came from
Magan, but this valuable relic shared the fate of the other
monuments and tablets recovered by Fresnel and Oppert,
and went down in the Tigris on May 23rd, 1855.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 329</span></p>

<p>Many stone vases of the late period of Sumerian
supremacy have been brought to light, but none so interesting
or so illuminating as that of Gudea, patesi of
Lagash (cf. Figs. <a href="#fig90">90</a> <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>). This unique vase of dark
green steatite is between eight and nine inches high, and
rests upon a narrow circular base. It is furnished with
a very small spout which could only allow but a small
quantity of liquid to pass at a time. The decoration is
of the most elaborate order: two entwined serpents
occupy the central part of the design, their sinuous
coils encircled round a long staff traversing the whole
height of the vase, while their tongues are seen touching
the edge of the vase near the embryonic spout.
The serpents are flanked by two strangely composite
and highly mythical creatures which face each other;
in the grasp of each is a long spear provided with
a semicircular lateral handle, an exact replica of the
copper weapon discovered by De Sarzec at Tellô,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> the
site where this vase was also found. These winged
monsters have the body and head of a serpent, and are
provided with claws and talons, while their tails find
their fitting termination in the sting of a scorpion; their
necks are encircled with twisted tails, and their head-gears
consist in a kind of horned cap, an indication of
the supernatural powers of these extraordinary monstrosities.
But in spite of the highly mythical character
of these creatures, the artist has not lost sight of the
general appearance of the serpent that has, as it were
supplied the material and natural foundation for the
unnatural additions which his imaginative mind has
superimposed, the scaly skin of the snake being portrayed
by means of inlaid fragments of marble. The
inscription informs us that this vase was dedicated to
the god Nin-gish-zi-da by Gudea for the prolongation
of his life.</p>

<p>Another stone vessel of a somewhat unique character
<a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 330</span>is the dark alabaster bowl in the Nimrûd Central Saloon
of the British Museum; it is sculptured in relief with
a scene of Gilgamesh and Ea-bani wrestling with lions,
but unfortunately it is in a very poor state of preservation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig91" id="fig91" />

<p>But the practice of making vases of stone did not
cease with the decline of Babylonian supremacy; the
Assyrians imitated their cultural progenitors in this as
in all other matters. The most interesting stone vase
belonging to the Assyrian era is that bearing an inscription
of Sennacherib (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig91">91</a>, A). It is a kind of amphora
though the two handles are nearly worn away.
The shape and proportions of this vase are very artistic,
and the curves well rounded off. In general contour it
somewhat resembles the little glass vase of Sargon, a
yet more remarkable relic of antiquity (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig91">91</a>, C).
Another interesting example of Assyrian stone-ware
is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig91">91</a>, B; the vase, which is decorated round
the neck, bears the traces of a well-nigh effaced inscription,
and like the small glass vase of this same
king is engraved with a small lion. It is shaped differently
from most of the stone vases of the period, and
has a charm and beauty all its own. Various glass
vessels and tubes were recovered from the ruins of
Babil, Kouyunjik and elsewhere, but their date is in
<a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 331</span>nearly all cases an uncertain quantity. Assyrian and
Babylonian glass would appear to have been made in
the ordinary way, i.e. by a mixture of silex or sand with
alkalis, while it was fashioned into the required shape
by means of a blow-pipe, and finished off with a turning
machine, of which the marks are sometimes still
visible. This is the case with the little vase of Sargon
illustrated above.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>Stone-ware of the late Babylonian period is well illustrated
by the jar-fragment of Nebuchadnezzar (604-561
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) published by W. L. Nash in the <i>Proceedings
of the Society of Biblical Archæology</i> (1910, p. 180). The
inscription is very brief and apart from the king&#8217;s name
only has the numeral &#8220;one,&#8221; which was probably followed
by a measure, but the name of the latter is broken away.
This stone jar like the Assyrian jars differs from most
of the inscribed vessels of earlier times, which usually
bear a dedicatory inscription, while in shape it is not
unlike the Assyrian jars seen in Fig. <a href="#fig91">91</a>.</p>

<p>Allusion has elsewhere been made (cf. p. <a href="#Page_86">86</a>) to the
marble vase bearing the name of Xerxes in cuneiform
and Egyptian hieroglyphics, but a number of similar
vases and fragments bearing an inscription of this same
king have also been brought to light. One such vase
was found by Newton at Halicarnassus in Asia Minor,
the fragments of another being found by Loftus at Susa,
while a third (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig91">91</a>, D) recently acquired by the
Babylonian Museum of the University of Pennsylvania,
is published by Clay in the <i>Museum Journal</i> (1910, I,
p. 6). It bears the royal inscription of Xerxes the Great
written in four different languages, Persian, Elamite,
Babylonian and Egyptian, the last-named being written
in the old hieroglyphics, and the other three in cuneiform.
The vase measures nine and seven-eighths inches
in height, and eight and fifteen-sixteenths inches in
diameter.</p>

<p>Although stone-ware appears to have been used more
frequently in the earlier periods of Mesopotamian civilization,
it must be not supposed that terra-cotta pottery
was not also used by the ancient Sumerians and early
Semites. A vast quantity of pottery comprising bowls,
phials, flat vases, chalice goblets, oval pots and vessels
of every description, size, shape and form has been recovered
from Tellô, Nippur, Fâra and other recently
excavated sites in Babylonia, and indeed so numerous
and so manifold are the vessels in question that only a
long and systematic study of the mass of material now
available, as thorough and exhaustive as that made by
Professor Flinders Petrie of Egyptian pottery, would
justify any attempt to classify and date the different
specimens. The earlier excavations in Mesopotamia
similarly yielded a large number of terra-cotta pots and
jars, but unfortunately there is so much uncertainty as
to the locality from which many of them came, and even
where that is known, there is generally no means of
ascertaining in what strata they were found&#8212;(as is unhappily
also the case with a good deal of the pottery
discovered in recent years)&#8212;and as they further bear
no inscriptions, any attempted systematization in our
<a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 333</span>present state of knowledge is inevitably based largely
on unproved and unprovable hypotheses. Two good
examples of early pre-Sargonic pottery are seen in
Figs. <a href="#fig92">92</a>, <a href="#fig92">93</a>. Both the cup (Fig. <a href="#fig92">92</a>) and the vase
(Fig. <a href="#fig92">93</a>) were discovered in the pre-Sargonic strata at
Nippur.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> Many other interesting specimens of early
pottery were discovered on the same site, some being
apparently black in colour, others being red. In a room
beneath the pavement of Narâm-Sin two vases were
brought to light which illustrate the remarkable differences
in size and shape exhibited by early Babylonian
pottery, one of these vases being bell-shaped and having
a flat bottom twice as large in diameter as its mouth,
while the other, a little over two feet high and one foot
nine inches across the top, was decorated with a rope
pattern.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>Among the minor results attending the excavations
at Bismâya was the recovery of a vast number of terra-cotta
vases, some entire, others only fragmentary.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>
They were found in graves, wells, and drains as well as
in the various platforms contained in the mound, and
in the plain itself. Between twenty-five and twenty-six
feet below the surface two large burial urns were discovered,
while at a depth of some thirty-four feet a
smaller urn was brought to light. The earliest examples
of pottery were found more than forty-four feet
below the surface. In the larger vases and urns the clay
appears to have been mixed with chopped straw,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> the
clay itself being as a rule of a yellowish brown colour,
but according to Banks, the clay was burnt to a deep
brown or black colour in the earliest times. The wheel
seems to have been used at all periods, though not to the
<a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 334</span>exclusion of hand-made pottery. One of the pre-Sargonic
vases from this site was apparently formed by placing
the clay on a flat surface, which the potter revolved
with one hand while fashioning the clay into the required
shape with the other hand; as Banks suggests, this may
have been the origin of the potter&#8217;s wheel. The vessels
from Bismâya vary in height from a little over an inch to
just under thirty inches, and they exhibit every conceivable
kind of shape. The surfaces of most of them are
plain, but some are decorated with dots, squares, concentric
circles and grooves. Two large vases are painted with
the marks of their makers or owners in black, but these
are regarded by Banks as post-Babylonian. Some of the
vases are provided with covers, the cover of one of
the funeral urns consisting in a kind of dish; sometimes,
in the case of vases which were buried, a woven
cloth was fastened over the mouth and sealed with clay.
These cloths have of course long since perished, but the
marks of the threads on the clay are still visible.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> One
vase is shaped like a boat, while another interesting
terra-cotta object discovered on this site is a lamp terminating
in the head of an ox.</p>

<p>Some very unique specimens of Babylonian black
pottery with incised lines filled with white paste were
discovered by Capt. Cros at Tellô. These vases were
not only decorated with geometrical designs, but also
with fish, boats, water-fowl and other river scenes.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> This
type of pottery is of frequent occurrence in the ancient
world. It has been found in Susa on the east, while in
the west it penetrated as far as Spain. Of Babylonian
pottery belonging to the Kassite period, mention should
especially be made of three vases discovered by Peters
and Haynes at Nippur. These pots are decorated with
<a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 335</span>green and yellow stripes, and were enclosed in an urn
together with three small boxes, the largest of which was
ornamented with knobs. Along with these articles more
than a hundred discs and crescents pierced for the purposes
of suspension, and mostly coloured black or white,
were also found. One of the best examples of late pottery
is the delicately-shaped and well-preserved amphora discovered
by Koldewey at Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> but it must probably
be assigned to the Roman period.</p>

<p>With regard to Assyrian pottery we are in a still
greater state of ignorance, in spite of the wealth of
material at hand. Large quantities of pottery were
brought to light by Botta, Layard and other early excavators,
but unfortunately their archæological importance
seemed as nothing compared with colossal bulls,
sculptured bas-reliefs, or even prosaic clay tablets, and
the result of this fortunately bygone apathy is that the
site from which they came is sometimes not ascertainable,
while on hardly any occasion is it possible to discover
the building or immediate locality where they were
found.</p>

<p>But the scientific excavations carried on by Koldewey
and Andrae at Ashur are calculated to yield more satisfactory
results in this connection. These excavations
have already thrown light on the early pottery of Assyria,
in the discovery of clay vessels decorated with black and
red geometrical designs and assigned to the prehistoric
period.</p>

<p>Another interesting specimen of Assyrian pottery
found on the same site consists in a large round vase
decorated about the top and having two handles.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>In Pl. <a href="#pXXXIII">XXXIII</a> we have a miscellaneous group of
pottery from the ruined mounds of Nineveh, and a
similar group from Nimrûd. The pots here displayed
show much variation both in size and form,
but little more can be said about them. Apart, however,
<a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 336</span>from the complete vessels in clay, a number of
fragments of bowls have been recovered bearing inscriptions
of kings of Assyria who reigned between
1140-681<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span> These inscriptions are principally concerned
with the various building-operations undertaken
during the reign of the king in question. Were these
bowls complete they would be of immense importance
in arriving at some definite idea as to the shapes and
sizes of vases in vogue at the different periods to which
they belong. But as fortune or misfortune has it, hardly
any of the well-preserved cups and bowls as yet recovered
bear any inscription or design at all, and this is one of
the great difficulties with which the student of Babylonian
and Assyrian pottery has to contend. Sometimes
a coloured glaze was applied to the surface of terra-cotta
vessels, but to what extent this practice prevailed in early
times it is hard to say.</p>

<p>Probably the two most striking pots yielded by the
excavations are those numbered 91941 and 91950 in
the British Museum collections. The former is a large
jar nineteen inches high and eighteen and three-quarter
inches in diameter, upon which is portrayed the figure
of a man with the tail of a goat and the claws of an
eagle, while the broken remains of one handle are still
preserved. The latter is a six-handled vase two feet
six inches high, on the body of which rude figures and
dragon-like animals are depicted, but both of these vases
probably belong to post-Assyrian times.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII&#8212;DRESS, MILITARY ACCOUTREMENTS, ETC.</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE full dress of the earliest Sumerians comprised
nothing more elaborate than a skirt fastened
round the waist and probably made of wool. But the
taste for decoration shown by all primitive peoples is
evinced by the Sumerians at a very early date, and they
seek to relieve the dead monotony of the skirt by edging
the bottom with a fringe (cf. Figs. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, <a href="#fig52">52</a>), the fringe
on the earliest monuments being formed by a series of
pointed tags. In the time of Ur-Ninâ, the archaically
fringed skirt has given place to an elaborately flounced
and pleated skirt&#8212;at least in the case of kings and magnates
(cf. Figs. <a href="#fig26">26</a>, <a href="#fig27">27</a>), but the upper part of the body
was left entirely bare; people of particularly high rank
are however sometimes seen wearing a skirt with an
upper part attached, which covered the left shoulder as
is the case with the leader of the procession on Ur-Ninâ&#8217;s
tablet (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig26">26</a>), though it is noticeable that Ur-Ninâ
himself here has no clothing on the upper part of his
body. Later on the king of Lagash still wears the
flounced skirt, but has another garment over it: this
upper garment was also apparently made of wool, and
passed over the left shoulder and under the right arm
(cf. Pl. <a href="#pXII">XII</a>); as this is, however, a battle scene, the
upper garment may be part of the king&#8217;s military insignia.
This custom of leaving the right arm and
shoulder free obtained right down to the time of Gudea
(cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXIII">XXIII</a>) and Khammurabi (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXIVa">XIV</a>).</p>

<p>The heads of the majority of the figures on the early
sculptures are hairless and beardless, though as we have
<a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 338</span>seen (cf. p. <a href="#Page_183">183</a>) long hair and a pronounced beard
were not infrequently worn, the hair on the head&#8212;possibly
a wig&#8212;sometimes being allowed to hang
down the neck (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, B, C), sometimes being
gathered up behind and secured by a fillet (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXII">XII</a>).
This seems to have been done by the king when on active
service, doubtless with a view to making his helmet more
comfortable and secure. As nearly all these early figures
are without hats or head-gear of any kind, we are almost
entirely in ignorance as to the nature of their head-coverings&#8212;if,
indeed, they had any. Sometimes feathers
were worn (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, A), while a figure resembling
Gilgamesh on one of the most ancient Sumerian bas-reliefs
(cf. <i>Découvertes</i>, Pl. I, 1) in existence, has a flat head-gear
of indeterminate character, the deity on the same
archaic sculpture wearing what appears to be an early
form of the horned head-dress of the gods in later
times.</p>

<p>The dress of early Sumerian women is somewhat uncertain;
if we might assume the form of dress shown
on the little stone statuette discovered by De Sarzec
at Tellô (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig33">33</a>, p. 224) to be typical, the feminine
dress of the period would appear to have consisted
in a flounced woollen skirt hung from the left
shoulder, the right arm and shoulder being exposed.
The length of the fillet-bound hair in the statuette referred
to removes all doubt as to the sex, and it is noteworthy
that the dress of this Sumerian woman is exactly
the same as that of the individual on Ur-Ninâ&#8217;s stele
referred to above, and of course the personage there
may conceivably be a woman also (cf. further p. <a href="#Page_186">186</a>).
But the little copper statuettes of women belonging to
the same period always show a nude bust, it is therefore
probable that the women of the time generally wore
an ordinary skirt like the men, the shoulder-suspended
garments being reserved for the élite.</p>

<p>The dress of royalties and grandees differed however
<a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 339</span>from that of the commonalty in quality rather than in
character: thus the skirts of all Ur-Ninâ&#8217;s courtiers&#8212;the
distinguished leader of the procession alone being
excepted&#8212;are much the same as that of their royal
master; but the quality is very different, the one being
entirely plain, the other extremely elaborate.</p>

<p>In later times what had been the exception seemingly
becomes the rule, and in Gudea&#8217;s period the left shoulder
was always covered by the folds of the mantle-like garment
then in vogue; while the Semite Narâm-Sin, of
yet earlier date than Gudea, wears a plaid passing over
his left shoulder and wrapped around his body, leaving
the right arm similarly free. The pleated plaid worn
by Narâm-Sin finds a striking parallel in the garments
worn by Nin-gish-zi-da and the accompanying deity on a
Gudea stele in the Berlin Museum (cf. <i>Sum. and Sem.</i>,
Taf. VII). The royal head-gear of Gudea differs from
that of later times, and probably from that worn by the
earlier rulers of Lagash: it consists in an embroidered
turban, differing entirely from the conical-shaped cap
worn by Narâm-Sin on the Pir-Hussein stele, and the
similar shaped crowns of the later Assyrian kings, but
bearing some resemblance to that worn by Khammurabi
on his famous code-stele (cf. Plates, <a href="#pXXIII">XXXIII</a>, <a href="#pXIVa">XIV</a>;
Fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>).</p>

<p>But while the Semite Narâm-Sin wears a long beard,
the Sumerian Gudea is still beardless. So too the
Semite Khammurabi wears a long beard, but the mantle
slung from his left shoulder is not unlike that of Gudea,
while the vesture of the god Shamash on the same stele
is pleated like that of Narâm-Sin, though the material
would appear to be different. In a later relief of the
time of Nabû-aplu-iddina, king of Babylon about 870<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>,
the god Shamash wears a striped robe with sleeves, and
the practice of leaving the right arm and shoulder exposed
seems to have by this time fallen into desuetude
(cf. Pl. <a href="#pXIVa">XIV</a>).</p>

<p><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 340</span></p>

<p>Of the dress of the women in the days of Gudea we
have a good illustration in Pl. <a href="#pXXIII">XXIII</a>. She wears a gracefully
fringed mantle, which was apparently<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> first pressed
over the breasts and carried under the arms, after which
it was crossed at the back, the two ends being brought
over the shoulders and made to hang symmetrically in
front.</p>

<p>The grave-deposits have afforded abundant evidence
of the extensive use of jewellery even in the earliest Sumerian
times, thus at Fâra necklaces of amethyst, coral,
lapis lazuli, mother of pearl and agate were found, while
other early sites yield similar testimony.</p>

<p>For information regarding the military accoutrements
of the early Sumerians we are mainly dependent on the
bas-reliefs of the period, of which the Vulture Stele is
the most important. The long lance or spear, which
was apparently grasped by both hands (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXII">XII</a>),
was clearly the principal weapon of offence, while the
axe, the dart, a club or mace, a curved weapon&#8212;generally
hitherto regarded as a throwing-stick or boomerang&#8212;and
a lance were also in use. Very few
Sumerian weapons have been brought to light, but in
addition to those enumerated in the chapter on Metals,
mention may be made of an archaic axe-head made of
agate, now in the American Museum of Natural History;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>
the characters with which it is inscribed are
somewhat more wedge-shaped than those found on the
monuments of Gudea, and it may accordingly be assigned
to a rather later date. Another axe-head, also made of
agate, and inscribed with early line characters, is in the
Metropolitan Museum, New York,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> while a number of
baked clay balls and some small stone eggs, as well as
copper arrows, spears, axes and stone clubs were discovered
in the pre-Sargonic strata at Nippur. The
<a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 341</span>discovery of arrows belonging to such an early date is
of considerable interest, as it has been contended that the
bow and arrow were introduced by the Semites chiefly owing
to the fact that it has been thought that these weapons
were not represented in early Sumerian art. But a very
early example of the bow in Babylonian art is afforded
by an archaic shell cylinder-seal published by Ward.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>
The human beings and gods on this seal are clad in the
Sumerian short skirt and not in the Semitic plaid, while
the occurrence of a bison on the top of a mountain, an
animal which is only represented on very early seals,
further argues the antiquity of the cylinder-seal in question,
and therefore of the use of the bow and arrow
depicted upon it. The discovery of clay balls and stone
missiles similarly appear to afford evidence of the use
of the sling at a very much earlier period than was
hitherto supposed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig94" id="fig94" />
<img src="images/fig94.jpg" width="500" height="379" alt="Fig. 94." />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 94.</span></p></div>

<p>It is interesting to trace the history of the boomerang-shaped
weapon shouldered by one of the figures on the
archaic fragment of the circular bas-relief reproduced
in Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>, B. The curved weapon<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> may have originally
been a throwing-stick or boomerang, though its shape
is the only argument in support of this theory. But
whatever its original use may have been, there is evidence
that a weapon of this shape was wielded as a club
or primitive sword at a very early period. In a sculpture
belonging to a slightly later period than the above-mentioned
bas-relief, the weapon in question has lost
its simplicity and is no longer made in one piece but
is composed of three narrow pieces held together by a
number of rings. Were this curiously shaped implement
only found in the hands of rulers or dignitaries,
the rings might merely be decorative accessories, but
its occurrence in the hand of a huntsman attacking a lion,
(cf. Fig. <a href="#fig78">78</a>) makes it incumbent that we should seek
<a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 342</span>for some more adequate and practical reason for the
existence of these rings. Doubtless this later form was
adopted with a view to increasing the efficiency of the
weapon. The weapon is here used at close quarters, and
was clearly not used as a throwing-stick at this period,
but rather as a kind of sabre. At an early date the
Sumerian must have sought for some means of rendering
his weapon more serviceable, and have conceived
the idea of substituting a blade of flint or obsidian, and
in point of fact numerous edged pieces of flint and obsidian
as well as primitive saw-blades with teeth have
actually been found in early Babylonian ruins. The
problem of affixing this blade to the handle or shaft,
would find its natural solution in fashioning the latter,
of two or more pieces between which the obsidian or
flint blade might be inserted, both wood and blade being
kept in place by rings; of its early use as a club or sabre
we have evidence on the archaic shell reproduced in
Fig. <a href="#fig78">78</a>, where the huntsman is seen holding a curved
<a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 343</span>implement which is composed of three pieces of wood
bound together by rings, as on the Vulture Stele, it is
obviously not employed here as a throwing-stick but as
a weapon for use at close quarters (cf. also Fig. <a href="#fig94">94</a>, A. B).</p>

<p>In the later period of Gudea we find the same style of
weapon in use. Upon a bas-relief recovered by Commandant
Cros from Tellô, and belonging to Gudea, we
see a curved weapon (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig94">94</a>, C)<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> terminating in a
lion&#8217;s head and having a blade which was apparently inserted
in a longitudinal slit made in the wood. Sometimes
these curved weapons were made of one piece of metal, as
was the case with the two examples discovered by Commandant
Cros in an early Babylonian grave, one of
which is reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig94">94</a>, D. Both of these weapons
are made of copper and were found in a coffin consisting
of two bell-shaped pots cemented together by bitumen.
The one in the figure is the more elaborate of the two,
and unlike its companion, has the handle still preserved
while its total length is about sixteen inches. The edge
of the blade was of course on the outside of the curve,
the instrument thus resembling a scimitar or short
curved sword. It is thus possible that the scimitar, or
at least the archetype of the scimitar owes its origin to
the Sumerians.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> The other weapon is of a more primitive
character and recalls the earlier examples afforded
by the bas-reliefs more vividly, while its blade is double
edged. In Assyrian times the curved end becomes quasi-circular
in form and the outer edge is furnished with
teeth, as is the case with the sceptre which Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal
holds in his hand (Pl. <a href="#pXXIV">XXIV</a>). The arms borne by
Eannatum himself as represented on the Vulture Stele
are the curved weapon already alluded to, a number of
darts some of which are double pointed, and a long
lance. Eannatum is in the act of piercing the head of a
vanquished foe with his lance, which he holds horizontally
<a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 344</span>over his head at the extreme end. According to
Commandant Cros, the lance is used in exactly the same
way by the Arabs of Irak to-day. It is first held loosely
in the middle, while the action consists in throwing it
forcibly through the hand till the lower end of it is
reached, but it is not allowed to escape from the hand
altogether; the weapon is therefore used in part as a
spear, and in part as a javelin.</p>

<p>For information regarding the military accoutrements
in use at the time of Shar-Gâni-sharri and Narâm-Sin
we are mainly dependent on the stele of the last-named
monarch (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXIII">XIII</a>), and the bas-relief fragments reproduced
in Fig. <a href="#fig28">28</a>, B, C. The bow and arrow would appear
to be the principal weapons used by the Semites,
though the spear and the axe also occur on early Semitic
monuments. One noticeable feature in these two sculptures
is the absence of any kind of shield.</p>

<p>The cylinder-seals contribute little towards the solution
of the manifold problems incidental to a study of
early military affairs, as those seals which are engraved
with battle-scenes are for the most part Persian in
origin.</p>

<p>To attempt to describe the complete wardrobe of the
Assyrians would be almost as difficult as to give a full
and comprehensive account of English dress to-day. The
costumes are so various, and often so finely-wrought,
that even a brief review of the different &#8220;modes&#8221; would
far exceed the bounds of a single chapter. The king&#8217;s
robes are, of course, the most magnificent and most
elaborate both in arrangement and decoration. In Pl.
<a href="#pXV">XV</a> we see Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal, king of Assyria (<span class="smcap">885-860
B.C.</span>) arrayed in his ceremonial robes. In comparison
with the festive garments of his successors, they are
simple and inornate, and are merely a replica of those
worn by the mythical being behind, the only difference
being that those of the king are arranged so as
to conceal both his legs, the exposure of the royal leg
<a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 345</span>being apparently out of accord with kingly dignity. The
under-garment seems to be a fringed robe or chasuble,
over which a long, deeply-fringed mantle is arranged;
both the king and his divine attendant wear a broad
waist-band into which two daggers are thrust; but the
mantle itself was apparently fastened by means of cords
ending in tassels. The king&#8217;s head-dress, however, is
entirely different from that of his follower; it is shaped
somewhat like a mitre, two tails being similarly attached
to the back. The royal tiara worn by the later kings of
Assyria conforms to the same type, only it is more richly
decorated and exhibits some variation in regard to its
shape. It would appear to have been coloured, if we
may trust the evidence afforded by the enamelled bricks
from Khorsabad,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> the colours being red, white and yellow,
the latter perhaps being intended to represent gold
braid. Judging from its general appearance, the head-dress
itself must have been made of cloth.</p>

<p>Both figures here (Pl. <a href="#pXV">XV</a>) wear a bracelet on either
wrist and two armlets on their sinewy arms, while a
necklace encircles their bull-like necks. Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal,
like all Assyrian kings, has a thick crop of hair and
a very strong beard. Shalmaneser II, his son and successor,
wears much the same dress as his father and the
same conical head-gear (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig44">44</a>), but Sennacherib
one hundred and twenty years later is no longer content
with the simple yet dignified dress of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal
and Shalmaneser, but assumes a far richer and costlier
set of robes (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>). The royal mantle is not
merely decorated with a fringe but is most elaborately
embroidered throughout, while his crown is also far
more ornate than those worn by his Nimrûd predecessors,
but his attitude is precisely the same as that of
Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal in Pl. <a href="#pXV">XV</a>. Both kings are holding a
bow in their left hand and two arrows in their right. The
regal and ceremonial costume of Ashur-bani-pal contrasts
<a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 346</span>similarly with that of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal and his
immediate successors&#8212;his dress resembling that of
Sennacherib in its general ornateness (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXa">XX</a>) while
even the costume which he wears while reclining at meat
in his garden is far more elaborate than that worn by
Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal on the highest ceremonial occasions (cf.
Pl. <a href="#pXXI">XXI</a>).</p>

<p>Some uncertainty exists regarding the dress-materials
used by the Assyrians. Many garments were doubtless
made of wool or woollen stuffs as in the other
period, but a kind of cotton was also used, for Sennacherib
states that he imported trees that bore wool
or hair, from the south, and that the wool or hair was
subsequently clipped and utilized for the manufacture
of garments.</p>

<p>There is the same uncertainty as to the materials
used in embroidery, but there is no doubt about the
skill of the embroiderer, who must have been a veritable
artist, if we may judge from the bas-relief representations
of his work, a good example of which is reproduced
in Layard, Pl. 9. He clearly did not confine
himself to designs but aspired to artistic representations
and scenic effects. Conventional palm-trees, and four-winged
monsters are the most conspicuous features.
One of these monsters is grasping one of the back legs
of a lion in either hand, while the lions are making ruthless
attacks on passively resisting bulls.</p>

<p>Women are seldom portrayed on the Assyrian bas-reliefs,
but we at all events know that the lady who had
the honour of being Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s queen was quite
as richly clad as her royal master (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXXI">XXI</a>), while
both wear ornamental fillets round their heads. Jewellery
seems to have been prized and loved by the Assyrian
king and his courtiers almost as much as by the women
of to-day, and the demand for &#8220;novelties&#8221; must have
taxed the jeweller&#8217;s inventive faculties to the utmost.
Not only were armlets and bracelets in requisition, but
<a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 347</span>also necklaces, ear-rings, and trinkets. The latter generally
took the form of divine or astrological symbols,
one of the most interesting ornaments worn by the king
being exactly like a Maltese cross, and closely resembles
the cross found on Kassite seals (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a>). The
trinkets were suspended on a cord which encircled the
royal neck, above which the real necklace is seen. Both
bracelets and ear-rings show great variety in design and
no little skill in workmanship. Unfortunately but few
articles of jewellery (apart from a number of bead-necklaces<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a>)
have been recovered, and of the majority of these
it is impossible to tell the date, but thanks to the bas-reliefs
we can gain a very fair idea of the proficiency to
which the jeweller&#8217;s art had been brought at this period,
though we cannot be sure of the metals used in each
particular case. In Fig. <a href="#fig95">95</a> we have a group of bracelets
of manifold shapes and designs, the rosette as usual
playing the leading part in most of the decorative devices.
In A we have an example of a royal necklace;
it is simple and neat in design and presents a striking
contrast to that worn by one of the winged figures from
Nimrûd (cf. B) which is decorated at the opening with
heads of animals. The ear-rings worn by kings, warriors,
priests and mythical beings vary quite as much
as the bracelets, though there is a certain similarity between
most of them (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig95">95</a>). The drops are in
nearly all cases long, and they frequently have a cross
piece which gives them the general appearance of a
&#8220;crux ansata.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 348</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95.</span></p></div>

<p>The toilet requisites of the Babylonians and Assyrians
were doubtless much the same as those in use to-day,
though but few articles from the dressing-table have
been recovered, the most notable of which are the combs
now preserved in the Louvre (cf. Figs. <a href="#fig96">96</a>, <a href="#fig97">97</a>). They
<a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 349</span>are made of ebony and measure about three and a half
inches across, while they are elaborately decorated in the
centre with the figures of sphinxes or lions, sometimes
realized in open-work, sometimes in relief. The teeth
on one side are large and few, those on the other being
slender and numerous. A similar comb was discovered
by Koldewey at Babylon, the centre of which is decorated
with the figure of a winged bull.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<p>Sandals formed the principal footwear of civilians&#8212;royalties
or commoners as the case may be&#8212;though the
feet were often left bare. The ordinary sandal had a thin
sole and a small cap for the heel, apparently made of
strips of leather which were sometimes coloured red
and blue alternately, though more frequently the entire
sandal was of a reddish hue, while it was held in position
by a loop round the great toe, and by a string which was
laced across the instep and tied in a bow. This was the
type of sandal worn by Sargon. There was, however, an
entirely different sandal in vogue at the time of Ashur-bani-pal;
the sole of this later sandal was of considerable
thickness, especially at the heel, while the upper
leather did not merely form a protecting cap to the heel
but covered the whole side of the foot. But shoes
<a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 350</span>were used as well as sandals as early as the time of
Sennacherib; those represented on the bas-reliefs are of
a clumsy make, though finely decorated with crescents
and rosettes, and they were seemingly laced in front.</p>

<p>But the military uniforms of the Assyrians show far
greater variation than the apparel of kings, eunuchs
and attendants. In the early Assyrian period the foot-soldiers
wore a short tunic and a fringed girdle, their
heads being protected by a pointed helmet; the arms,
legs, neck and feet were generally bare, though the latter
were occasionally shod with plain sandals.
The infantry included archers,
spearmen and
swordsmen, while
the archers were often
further armed
with swords and
sometimes with
maces, and appear
to have formed the
pick of the foot-soldiers.
All three
divisions were protected
by small hand-shields, the bowmen often being attended
by another warrior armed with a spear, who acted
as shield-bearer. In the reign of Shalmaneser II we frequently
see the bowmen clad in a long coat of mail reaching
from the neck to the ankles (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig44">44</a>), but in the
Sargon period the difference in the equipment of the foot-soldiers
becomes more pronounced. There are at least
three different kinds of archer. First of all there was
the light-armed bowman, who was practically naked but
for a loin-cloth, which supported a quiver, and a head
fillet (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig100">100</a>). Next came the more simply equipped
of the heavy-armed (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig101">101</a>), who was clad in a coat
of mail reaching from the neck to the waist, beneath
which was a fringed tunic extending to the knees, while
<a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 351</span>their feet were generally protected by sandals, and the
head covered by a pointed helmet. The principal feature
which differentiated the appearance of the most
heavily armed archers from that of the foregoing was
the long deeply fringed tunic (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig102">102</a>), over which
a coat of mail was worn similar to that worn by the
archers of the second class.</p>

<p>The spearmen of the period are clad in much the same
way as the medium-armed archers, the most noticeable
point about them being their helmets, which are surmounted
by a crest of one kind or another (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig29">29</a>),
while another frequent peculiarity in their equipment is
the arrangement of their belts which cross each other on
the chest and back. Their feet are generally bare, though
sometimes they are shod in sandals, and occasionally in
a low boot.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>Sargon&#8217;s son, Sennacherib, appears to have largely reorganized
the infantry and instituted fresh corps. The
slingers seemingly make their first appearance in this
king&#8217;s reign, though the sling was known in Babylonia
even before the time of Shar-Gâni-sharri (cf. above, p.
<a href="#Page_341">341</a>). On the bas-reliefs of Sennacherib we see him fully
armed with helmet, coat of mail, tunic reaching to the
knees, close-fitting hose and a short boot, none of which
can have added to the efficiency of his services. There
<a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 352</span>were four types of archer, two heavy-armed and two
light-armed. The most heavily armed (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig103">103</a>) wore
a tunic, a coat of mail reaching to the waist, hose, short
boots, and a conical helmet, and are protected by long
shields carried by a shield-bearer. The next class have
no shield protection, and their legs and feet are entirely
bare (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig104">104</a>). The better equipped of the light-armed
are clad in a short tunic, wear a peculiar kind of
fillet round their heads, and sandals on their feet, while
they carry short swords at their sides and quivers on
their backs. Last come the lightest equipped archers of
all, who wear a striped tunic<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> reaching down to the knees
and somewhat longer behind than in front (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig105">105</a>).
Their feet, arms and legs are bare, and fillets form their
sole head-gear, while they are seldom armed with short
swords like the preceding.</p>

<p>There were apparently two classes of spearmen in
Sennacherib&#8217;s army; the better equipped wear a coat of
mail over their tunics, a conical helmet, hose on their
legs, and boots on their feet, while they are generally
armed with a comparatively short spear, a rather large
convex shield, and the usual short sword. The second
division are equipped in much the same way as the light-armed
spearmen of Sargon, and wear plain tunics, cross
belts, and crested helmets, but unlike the spearmen of
<a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 353</span>Sargon they usually have sleeves to their tunics, wear
hose on their legs, boots on their feet, and sometimes
carry a long convex shield arched at the top instead of a
round one. Yet another class of foot-soldiers deserve
a mention; these are armed with double-headed axes
which they use to cut down trees and clear the road for
the passage of troops. Their equipment closely resembles
that of the better-armed spearmen. The army in
Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s time is much the same as it was in the
time of Sennacherib; it comprised bowmen, spearmen,
mace-bearers, warriors armed with battle-axes and slingers.
In regard to the latter it is interesting to note that
the heavy armour of the slingers has been exchanged for
a lighter and more serviceable garb.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>The principal weapon of the cavalry in the early
period was the bow, though sword and shield both
occur, but were apparently not much used. It was
customary for the mounted archers to be accompanied
by another mounted soldier whose office it was to hold
the bridle of the archer&#8217;s horse while the archer was
aiming his arrow at the enemy. The attendant wears a
plain tunic and an ordinary cap, while the archer has a
pointed helmet, an embroidered tunic and a sword belt.
Their legs and feet are bare to enable them to sit their
horses firmly&#8212;the latter being without saddles. In the
time of Sargon the cavalry consisted partly of spearmen,
partly of archers. Saddles or saddle-cloths somewhat
resembling those worn by European cavalry horses
to-day were in regular use, while the unarmed attendants
were no longer required, both archers and spearmen
being able to manage their own steeds. The uniforms
worn by the cavalry were similarly much more
elaborate than those worn by the mounted archers of
the earlier period. Their tunics are close-fitting, but expand
below the waist into a kind of fringed kilt, they
wear hose on their legs and long boots on their feet,
<a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 354</span>which sometimes reached nearly up to the knee; the principal
weapons borne by the horsemen are bows and spears,
but they are frequently armed with a short sword as
well, while the spearmen occasionally carry a bow and
quiver as well as a spear and a sword (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig106" id="fig106" />
<img src="images/fig106.jpg" width="500" height="408" alt="Fig. 106." />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 106.</span></p></div>

<p>In Sennacherib&#8217;s time, the ordinary cavalry are
equipped in much the same way; some of the regiments
however are heavily armed with a coat of mail extending
to the bottom of the back (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig107">107</a>). In the
sculptures of Ashur-bani-pal, the horses of the cavalry
are sometimes covered with a large cloth similar to that
carried by the chariot steeds (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig108">108</a>), over which
the saddle-piece is placed, but the equipment of the
cavalry themselves shows little or no variation from that
of former times.</p>

<p>The charioteers form the last division of the
Assyrian army to be briefly considered. The chariot
contained at least two persons&#8212;the driver and a warrior;
but when the king took the field in person he
was attended by a shield bearer, or sometimes two
<a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 355</span>shield bearers, as well as by a charioteer. The normal
weapon used by the chariot soldier is the bow, which
he generally has full drawn, the arrow on the string;
he is however not infrequently girded with a sword,
while a spear is often lying at his side within easy reach.
He is sometimes merely clad in a tunic, sometimes in
a long coat of mail reaching down at least as far as the
knees, but having short sleeves, doubtless with a view
to facilitating the manipulation of the bow. He either
discharges his shafts from the chariot itself, or else dismounts
in order to take a more certain aim; in the latter
case the attendant protects the bowmen by means of a
shield which he holds in his left hand, while in his right
hand he holds a spear or sword wherewith to repel any
close attack. The warrior generally wears a helmet which
is occasionally furnished with side and front pieces made
of metal scales, calculated to protect the shoulders, the
nape of the neck, and sometimes even the chin, but the
attendant as a rule has no covering for his head.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig107" id="fig107" />
<img src="images/fig107.jpg" width="500" height="233" alt="Fig. 107." />
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 107.</span></p></div>

<p>The chariots were drawn by either two or three
horses, but there was apparently never more than one
pole; accordingly when a third horse was harnessed to
the chariot, he must have been attached by a rope or
thong, and was probably taken as a relief-animal to fill
the place of one of the others in the event of either of
them being shot through. The trappings of the horses
<a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 356</span>were often very elaborate,
as may be seen in Figs. <a href="#fig83">83</a>,
while the chariots were also sometimes very ornate.
There are two main types of war-chariot represented
on the Assyrian bas-reliefs, one being characteristic of
the earlier period, when Calah (Nimrûd) was the capital
of the empire, the other of the later epoch when the seat
of the government was established at Nineveh. The
chariots of the early period are low and short, the wheels
<span class="figleft300" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig108" id="fig108" />
<img src="images/fig108.jpg" width="300" height="226" alt="Fig. 108." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 108.</span></span></span>
being comparatively small, and as a rule only having six
spokes, while the chariots portrayed on the later reliefs
are generally more capacious and also loftier, while the
wheels, which would appear to be about five feet in diameter,
are normally eight-spoked
(cf. Fig. <a href="#fig108">108</a>). A
position in one of these
later chariots consequently
gave the warrior a good
vantage ground for aiming
at the enemy and also
for viewing the situation.
The poles of the chariots
of both periods frequently
terminate in the head of an animal, an ox or a horse as
the case may be. Sometimes a cross-bar was fixed to the
end of the pole, which also occasionally terminated in the
heads of animals, the cross-bar being at times straight,
at others curved.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig109" id="fig109" />
<img src="images/fig109.jpg" width="500" height="376" alt="Fig. 109." />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 109.</span></p></div>

<p>From this brief description of the military equipment
of the Assyrians, it will be at once manifest how elaborate
must have been the organization of the army. Reference
has frequently been made to the conical-shaped
helmets of the soldiers, and the similarly shaped tiaras
of the kings, but it must not be supposed that all Assyrian
head-gears were conical. Some idea of the diversity
of head-coverings used in Assyria may be gained
from the selection reproduced in Fig. <a href="#fig109">109</a>. The most
noteworthy of these is the horned crown in the centre
<a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 357</span>(A), which was worn by the colossal winged-bulls. The
horns which are the symbol of divinity, occupy a prominent
position on the head-coverings of nearly all Babylonian
and Assyrian gods, and their presence on the
head-gear of a human-headed bull is indicative of the
divine character with which they endowed these colossi.
The top of this massive crown or hat is decorated with
a row of feathers, while its face is adorned with the
familiar rosettes. In (B) we have a royal tiara, and (C),
<a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 358</span>(D), (E) and (F) illustrate the different kinds of fillets
worn round the head, while (G) to (M) exhibit the various
types of helmets used in the Assyrian army.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig110" id="fig110" />
<img src="images/fig110.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="Fig. 110." />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 110.</span></p></div>

<p>The offensive and defensive weapons of the Assyrians,
however, exhibit even greater variations than their helmets.
Few actual weapons have been preserved, but
thanks to the vast quantity of bas-reliefs which Botta
and Layard have rescued from the ruined mounds of
Assyria, we are able to form some idea of the extensiveness
of an Assyrian armoury. The weapons of the
ordinary soldier are sufficiently simple in character, but
those which kings, demigods, or viziers wear are often
most ornate. In Fig. <a href="#fig110">110</a> we have a selection of the
more striking weapons represented on the bas-reliefs.
(A), (B), (C) and (D) show us four different kinds of pike
wielded by the warriors of Ashur; they vary in length
and their handles differ, but they all have a more or
<a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 359</span>less diamond-shaped blade, while the arrow-heads (E)
are shaped in the same manner. The two extremities
of the bow from which the king despatches his unerring
shafts into the heart of the enemy, the lion, or the
wild bull, and for which he also finds use in the performance
of religious ceremonies, often find their termination
in the head of a bird (F). But though the
arrows themselves are severely practical in their appearance,
the quivers in which they reposed when &#8220;off
duty&#8221; are more elaborate (cf. (G)-(L)). The largest of
these quivers could accommodate as many as five arrows
(cf. (L)), but the normal number seems to have been
four. The quiver was slung over the back by means of
cords (cf. (G), (J) and (L)). The swords would appear
to have been generally straight ((M) (N)), though sometimes
curved (O). The sword-hilt was frequently
adorned with several lions&#8217; heads, while the scabbard itself
was often decorated with lions, the result of which is
highly ornamental and effective. The sceptre was a ceremonial
weapon&#8212;inoffensive without doubt, but eloquently
symbolic of royalty (cf. (P)), while the dirk
(Q) on the other hand is brandished in a most alarming
manner by the composite monstrosities portrayed
on the palace walls of Ashur-na&#7779;ir-pal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig111" id="fig111" />
<img src="images/fig111.jpg" width="500" height="368" alt="Fig. 111." />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 111.</span></p></div>

<p>But by far the most formidable military invention of
the warlike Assyrians was the battering-ram; the ram
was brought to bear upon the wall of the besieged city by
a movable tower, in the shelter of which the ram could be
effectively and safely worked, the tower and the battering-ram
thus forming together a most potent factor in
both offensive and defensive operations. These movable
towers were by no means uniform, but varied both
in size and height, sometimes they were surmounted
by towers (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig111">111</a> (A)) from which the attacking
forces could shower their arrows upon the beleaguered
army with impunity, at other times they were quite low
and shaped liked a torpedo, the larger ones resting on
<a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 360</span>six wheels (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig44">44</a>), and the smaller on four (Q).
The ram itself also varied&#8212;sometimes it was set at an
angle slanting upwards (A), its projecting extremity being
at the same time heavier and thicker than the shaft, but
more usually the ram was fixed horizontally and pointed
like a spear (B), the tower sometimes being armed with
two of these rams (C). The most noticeable of the
shields here represented are the large shields, from behind
the shelter of which the bowman could aim and
<a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 361</span>shoot at his ease, the shield of course being held in
position by a shield-bearer (cf. (D), (E), (F)). These
large shields were generally upright (F), but were often
curved at the top to protect the head of the archer from
the missiles of the enemy (D), while sometimes the whole
shield was curved (E). But the lancers required no such
protection, a small hand-shield which they could carry
themselves being the only type of defence which would
not completely nullify their usefulness in the field.
These shields varied in shape and size; they were
generally round (cf. (G)-(K)), but sometimes curved
and oblong (L), while at other times they were concave
in the body, oval at the top, straight at the bottom, and
decorated with a boss in the centre and an engraved design
round the edge (cf. (N)). Another type of shield
was shaped somewhat like a lozenge (O), but they all
alike have their handles in the centre. They were often
most elaborately engraved, the designs being formed by
an arrangement of straight lines ((G) and (P)), geometrical
figures ((H) and (L)), or circles of rosettes ((I)
and (J)). One of the shields illustrated here differs
from the rest in having its outer face notched like the
edge of a saw, and must have served offensive as well
as defensive purposes (cf. (M)).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig112" id="fig112" />
<img src="images/fig112.jpg" width="500" height="380" alt="Fig. 112." />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 112.</span></p></div>

<p>But the Assyrians waged war &#8220;terra marique,&#8221;&#8212;on
the sea as well as on dry land, and in Fig. <a href="#fig112">112</a> (A)
we have an example of one of the war-galleys used
by Sennacherib in his pursuit of the Babylonian rebels
across the mouth of the Persian Gulf. It is a bireme,
i.e. a boat with two banks of oars; below are the oarsmen,
while the warriors are stationed on an upper
deck. The boat is shaped rather like a cutter in front,
but the stern ends off in a sweeping upward curve, and
there is a mast and cross-beam secured by yards in
the fore-part of the galley. The course of the boat is
steered by means of two oars worked from behind,
which differ in shape from those used to propel the
<a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 362</span>boat. In (B) we have another variety of this type of
craft: here both ends of the boat are curved, the extremities
being squared off instead of pointed as in (A),
and there is moreover no mast, but in (C) we have a
different kind of boat altogether; it is an open boat
with only one bank of oars and there are no warriors
aboard. There are only four rowers and their oars are
totally different from those used in the war-galleys, the
oars of the galleys resembling long shafted spades, while
those here are not unlike hockey sticks. Both prow and
<a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 363</span>stern are curved, the latter terminating in a horse&#8217;s
head, and in the centre of the boat there is a mast.
The custom of decorating the ends of a boat with an
animal&#8217;s head, no doubt originated among the Ph&#339;nicians,
who were the maritime people of the Oriental
world. In one of the scenes on the bronze gates from
Balâwât we see Shalmaneser II receiving the tribute of
the ships of Tyre and Sidon (D); these ships, or rather
boats, are curved at either end, while both prow and
stern are figured with the heads of camels. Only two
men are required to manipulate the heavily laden craft,
one of whom is apparently steering, while the other is
pulling the boat along with the aid of a very heavy and
clumsy-looking oar. But war-galleys were not the only
boats in use in the time of Sennacherib; a lighter and
far smaller boat was employed for the transport of goods
(E). The cargo occupies the centre of this odd little
vessel, on either side of which two oarsmen are busily
plying their oars. Strange to say, they appear to be
pulling in opposite directions, but we must possibly
attribute this anomaly to the sculptor&#8217;s ignorance of
nautical affairs; the oars are quite different from those
employed in the battleships, but they are exactly the
same as those used on the cargo raft above (F); the
raft seems to be loaded with large blocks of stone; the
wooden raft by itself is clearly incapable of sustaining
so heavy a weight, and the requisite buoyancy is attained
by fastening inflated skins to the nether part of the raft.
A kind of reed raft seems to have been used for traversing
the marshy districts of Lower Mesopotamia
(H), the reeds being tied together by means of osiers,
and the water excluded by a covering of leather or a
thick coating of bitumen. These reed crafts sometimes
assume the form of flat rafts, while at other times they
resemble canoes.</p>

of the early tablets from Tellô, we are able to obtain a
very fair idea of the manners and customs of the Sumerians
at the time of the first dynasty of Lagash.</p>

<p>An investigation of the conditions of any society
naturally commences with a brief consideration of the
laws, which regulated the process of propagation upon
which the continuance and prosperity of the community
ultimately depends. It would appear that from the earliest
Sumerian times marriage was regarded in the light
of a legal contract, and divorce could similarly only be
effected by legal procedure. But the Sumerian marriage
laws of the time of Lugal-anda and Urukagina differed
from the European laws of to-day in at least one important
point, the contract being made by the man with
his father-in-law rather than with his prospective wife,
and consequently in the case of divorce it was the father-in-law
and not the divorced wife who was entitled to
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Polyandry was evidently not unknown, for Urukagina
had occasion to apply the utmost rigour of the law to its
repression, although it had hitherto been by no means
condoned, but was on the contrary already regarded as a
<a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 365</span>criminal offence, and not only was this the case, but even
polygamy seems to have been discountenanced, for such
expressions as &#8220;the wife of the priest of Nin-girsu,&#8221; or
&#8220;the wife of the patesi&#8221; implicitly suggests that there
was only one lady in it, and that there was no liability
to confusion in the matter. It is however quite conceivable
that the patesi had an official wife, just like the
priests of Amen, or the kings of Egypt, the other ladies
of the harem not ranking with the royal spouse or enjoying
the same distinguishing appellative, but this is of
course a matter of conjecture. However that may be,
there is abundant evidence to show that the Sumerians
compare very favourably with other primitive peoples
in their regard for and treatment of women. They could
act as free agents in the matter of property, and could be
legal witnesses to contracts, while widows were especially
safeguarded against the extortion of those in power,
and the very poor were legally protected against the
rapacity of the priest, who exacted a kind of tithe from
the members of the community. Two other social reforms
carried out during this reign are noteworthy in this
connection, one being the abolition of the tax hitherto
laid upon the parties to a divorce, and the other, the reduction
of the priests&#8217; burial fees. But in spite of the
checks that it was thus found necessary to place upon the
extortionate priesthood, the service of the gods was deserving
of special recompense, and thus it was that in
accordance with this principle an orphan, the son of a
priestess of the goddess Bau, received a larger pension
than other orphans.</p>

<p>But apart from what may be termed domestic and
family duties, women were expected to perform other
functions even as early as the time of Urukagina. Some
women devoted themselves to the more menial services
of the gods and attended to the offerings of the sanctuary;
others again were employed as weavers, while
another class of women attached to the court were occupied
<a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 366</span>with the care of sheep, goats and other small
domestic animals. Some again were gate-keepers, and
a certain number pursued the art of hair-dressing.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the trades pursued by men
were more numerous and various. The boat-building
trade engaged a considerable number of the men of
Lagash, while carpenters and furniture-makers also
appear to have had plenty to do. The currier&#8217;s trade
similarly flourished, and among the more æsthetic
trades which were practised, perfumery and jewellery may
be specifically mentioned, while of the proficiency to
which the art of metal-working and stone-carving had
been brought, we have abundant evidence in the numerous
bas-reliefs, figures and statuettes that have come
down to us. A large part of the working population
were gardeners or tillers of the soil, for the Babylonians
had long since emerged from the bedouin stage of primitive
civilization, and had settled upon the land, which
they cultivated apparently with great success. Among
the domesticated animals of which they made use, the
cow, the sheep, the ass and the goat may be specifically
singled out. The ass was used both for riding and also
for draft purposes. The ox was the principal beast of
labour, his services being required both in the work of
irrigation and in the transport of building materials,
though the ass was also sometimes employed for these
and similar purposes. The ox was further used for food,
while cows were seemingly reserved for breeding and for
supplying milk, from which they made butter, and possibly
also cheese. The sheep was reared for the double
purpose of providing wool as a material for clothing,
and meat for consumption, some breeds being held in
particularly high value for their wool, while others were
specially prized for their tastiness as an article of diet,
though some were utilized for both of these purposes.
It appears to have been the custom to offer the flesh of
the sheep in whole or in part to the gods before mortal
<a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 367</span>man ventured to partake thereof, the shorn wool being
given over to the female weaver of the harem. The
sheep enjoying the especial royal patronage was white
in colour, and was therefore presumably the most uncommon
and the most highly valued, while the commonest
breed was brown. The male sheep or lamb
was usually selected for sacrifice to the gods in preference
to the female. The kid seems to have been regarded
as a medium of exchange, at all events rent was
paid by means of kids, or sometimes sheep, while the
goat often served as a sacrificial victim as we have seen
elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> The kids belonging to the goddess Bau
were tended by the women of the harem, though also
sometimes by herdsmen. Goats as well as sheep were
held in high value for their wool, two species being particularly
singled out, one being known as the white-fleeced
goat and the other as the black-fleeced. Other
animals of a nondescript character also played an important
part in the life of the people as well as in the service
of the gods. Birds too formed part of the offerings due
to the powers above, the principal of which were apparently
the goose, the duck, the chicken and the turtle
dove.</p>

<p>The fertility of the soil naturally encouraged its cultivation
even in the earliest times. Part of the land in
the time of Urukagina belonged to the royal domains,
the remainder being occupied by private individuals.
Cereals, such as corn and barley, were cultivated with
success, as in the days of Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> while some of the
land was reserved for fruit trees and vegetable products.</p>

<p>But the land was not entirely divided up into crown-lands
and landed estates, &#8220;small ownership&#8221; accounted
for a certain amount of the available ground, and it would
appear that even poor women sometimes had their little
plots; the small owners were often however the victims
of the extortionate capitalist, and their wrongs from time
<a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 368</span>to time called for redress. On such occasions the official
entrusted with the task of readjusting matters took great
care to distinguish between arable-land and land which
did not admit of being cultivated. The supervision of
the royal estates involved, as might be expected, the
employment of a whole army of agricultural officials with
different degrees of responsibility and varying duties
to perform. Agriculture in the time of Urukagina even
as to-day entailed a regular series of operations: the land
had to be ploughed, the seed sown, and the harvest
reaped, and last, but perhaps the most important and
the most laborious of all, there was the work of irrigation,
which in a land subject to floods in winter and a
rainless semi-tropical heat in summer required constant
attention and an infinite amount of hard work. The
cutting of canals, even in our own day, with all the appliances
at the disposal of modern hydraulic science, is
by no means an easy or quickly accomplished task, and
we can readily understand that the labour was no less,
and the process no simpler some four or five thousand
years ago. The work of irrigation, so essential and so
arduous, was not left to individual enterprise, but was
undertaken by the state and formed one of the principal
departments of public works, and the early rulers
of Lagash seem to have been as proud of their irrigation-engineering
performances as they were of their
triumphs on the battle-field. The persons employed
were either regular engineers, or else navvies turned on
to the work for the time being. But the work of irrigation
was not finished with the cutting of the canals;
some means had to be devised for conveying the water
from the canals to the soil.  No doubt in earlier times
this was done by means of a hand machine, perhaps consisting
in a bucket attached to a pole, to the other end
of which a counterpoising weight was suspended. In
Assyrian times,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> these machines were set by the side of
<a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 369</span>a &#8220;pit&#8221; or cistern, which was often a depression in the
bed of the stream, into which the buckets were lowered
and from which they were raised when full, or else a
pit dug actually on the field into which the water of the
canal flowed by means of a runnel. The machine itself
in its simplest form resembles the modern &#8220;shadûf,&#8221; such
as was used in ancient Egypt<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> and is in common use
among the fellahin of Upper Egypt to-day. But on big
estates some more efficient apparatus would be obviously
required, and was undoubtedly used, at all events by
the Assyrians. What the larger machines were, we do
not know, but as Johns suggests, they may have very
possibly consisted in a set of buckets fastened to a wheel,
which was revolved by oxen, the buckets taking up the
water as the wheel brought them to the bottom, and
emptying their contents on their way round: but whatever
the machine was it must have been fairly elaborate,
for it sometimes required as many as eight oxen to
work it.</p>

<p>The important part which agriculture played in the
life of the community is shown by the name of one of
the months which was called &#8220;the month during which
the oxen labour.&#8221; The rainy season of November and
December over, the labourers proceeded to sow the seed,
the harvest of which was to be reaped in the summer
during the &#8220;month of harvesting.&#8221; The corn was cut
with a kind of sickle, after which the grain was beaten or
else trodden by oxen on the field itself. Next it was
passed through a sieve, and was then ready to be distributed
or stored in the granaries.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, much the same animals were
reared for the maintenance and comfort of man some
five thousand years ago as to-day. Human nature and
human requirements vary but little compared with the
marked differences which separate one civilization from
another, and one stage of culture from one more primitive
<a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 370</span>or more advanced, though these differences are
indeed superficial rather than fundamental, but the
elementary laws upon which human life depends essentially
belong to those things which are fundamental,
and in that sense they are eternal. Thus it was that
the members of Urukagina&#8217;s community partook of
beef, mutton or lamb according to the season, as we do
to-day; his bill of fare however not only comprised
joints but also poultry and birds&#8212;chicken, duck, goose,
or turtle as the case might be. Fish of all kinds, including
both fresh-water and salt-water fish, were prepared
in various ways for food, while milk, butter and
cheese all appear to have been in regular use. Wheat
and barley, as we have several times had occasion to
note, were grown on a large scale, and without doubt
formed the staple food of the people, providing them
with an ample supply of material for cakes and different
kinds of bread, including milk loaves and black bread.
The principal fruits which were cultivated at this period,
were dates, figs, pomegranates and grapes: they were
eaten cooked and uncooked, sometimes forming part
of a fruit salad, at other times being made into fruit
cakes.</p>

<p>The date-palm flourished everywhere and was a
principal means of support to the poor, while the dates
themselves seem to have been used as a medium of
exchange. The apple appears to have been cultivated
and to have furnished certain drink,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> while the tamarisk
provided a kind of sweet gum. As regards vegetables,
onions, radishes, cucumbers and beans appear to have
been the most favoured, though various other vegetable
products, which have not as yet been identified, are
mentioned in the texts. At this early period the art of
fermenting cereals was already known, and beer, date-wine,
and other alcoholic drinks were to be found in the
Sumerian cellars.</p>

<p><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 371</span></p>

<p>With their arts and crafts we have dealt elsewhere, as
also with their architectural remains, which however
afford us little or no information regarding the structure
of private dwelling-places, but from the literature we
learn that wood as well as brick was used more extensively
in their building operations than we should suppose.
Wool formed the principal material for making
clothes, though linen was also possibly manufactured,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>
while fur was sometimes worn, presumably in the cold
weather.</p>

<p>Business transactions were made by contracts, the
transactions in question usually having reference to the
sale of slaves, animals or other property. The validity
of the contracts apparently depended upon their being
duly attested, as in later times, the witnesses receiving
gifts for their services. In regard to the purchase of
slaves, and the price which they fetched in the market,
it is a significant fact that according to the stele of
Manishtusu, an ass and a slave were worth exactly the
same, which betrays a lack of appreciation of the superiority
of the working capacity of a human being over
that of a brute beast.</p>

<p>But the crown and the church took good care not to
allow the laity the full possession of their own property,
and managed to make a very comfortable livelihood for
themselves by means of various impositions and taxes.
Farm produce, garden fruits, fish, cattle, wool and perfumes
were all levied as royal or ecclesiastical dues,
while the temple sacrifices were of course for the most
part mere perquisites of the priests, though the latter
had to hand a goodly proportion over to their royal
patron.</p>

<p>A civilization such as this, with its commercial enterprises
and its legal transactions, of course presupposes
the invention of systems for ascertaining the weights
and measures of the various objects and different forms
<a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 372</span>of property with which those transactions were immediately
concerned. There was a square or area measure,
a sine quâ non in property-conveyancing; there was a
long measure, equally necessary for the sale and purchase
of wood or stuffen goods, the smallest unit of
which appears to have been the thumb. Then again
the daily requirements of man made the invention of a
measure of capacity an absolute necessity. Other modes
of reckoning besides the regular metrical systems were
however sometimes adopted, thus fishermen appear
to have sold their fish either by number or by the basket,
while liquids were measured by means of different
sized vessels. Lastly there was a weight measure, which
was the same in Urukagina&#8217;s time as in that of the later
dynasty of Ur.</p>

<h4>2. <i>RELIGION</i></h4>

<p>The religion of the Babylonians and Assyrians was
polytheistic throughout the whole course of their history.
It is true that in later times a certain tendency
towards monotheism was exhibited, but it never became
forcible enough to create such a revolution in the religious
ideas of the people as the change from polytheism
to monotheism necessarily implies. The gods
worshipped in the later period of Gudea were, with the
exception of Nin-gish-zi-da the personal god of Gudea,
known and venerated in the time of Urukagina.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> It is
further an interesting and noteworthy fact that the name
Gishgibilgemesh (Gilgamesh) is sometimes accompanied
by the determinative for &#8220;god&#8221; in the literature of the
time, a clear indication that even at this date the hero
of Babylonian folk-lore was accredited with divine or
quasi-divine attributes. The local god of Lagash was
Nin-girsu; to him the land belonged, and it was he who
entrusted the government of it to the king; the people
of Lagash are indeed identified with their divine lord,
their triumphs are his, and their wrongs are crimes
<a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 373</span>against his godhead. The priest of Nin-girsu ranked
immediately after the patesi himself, and his temples
are entirely national in character. The very palace of
the patesi was in reality the house of Nin-girsu, while
that of his queen was the dwelling-place of Nin-girsu&#8217;s
divine spouse, the goddess Bau. Another goddess who
was deeply revered and worshipped even as early as
Ur-Ninâ&#8217;s day was the Lady Ninâ, from whom the
founder of the dynasty derived his royal name, while
the goddess Gatumdug, in whose honour Ur-Ninâ built
a temple, was regarded as the &#8220;Mother of Lagash.&#8221;
En-lil, the ever famous lord of Nippur, also occupied
a prominent place in the assemblage of gods at this time;
he is mentioned first in the royal protocols of Eannatum
and Entemena, and is also first in the divine invocations
on the Vulture Stele of the former ruler.</p>

<p>But the influence of the powers unseen upon the minds
and lives of the people is reflected in the authority of the
priests. The priest, minister or servant is not in truth
&#8220;greater than his lord,&#8221; but his authority and his power
are entirely proportional to those enjoyed by his heaven-born
master. The temptation on the part of earthly
emissaries to abuse the power which their position gives
them is generally found to be irresistible, and the priests
of Lagash were, as we have seen, no exceptions to the
all but universal rule. The power enjoyed by the high
priest of Nin-girsu may be judged from the fact that
both Enlitarzi and Enetarzi occupied this position before
they ascended the throne.</p>

<p>Sacrifice formed the principal part of early Sumerian
worship; animals, birds, fruit, vegetables, bread and
cakes all contributing to the heavily-laden altars of the
gods, and incidentally to the rapacious appetites and
pockets of the priests; offerings were also made to the
statues of the living and the dead, the offerings being
placed on an altar close to the statue; thus a certain
Shagshag seems to have derived satisfaction by placing
<a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 374</span>offerings before her own effigy, while the statue of the
deceased Ur-Ninâ was similarly honoured. Another
interesting practice in vogue at this period was that of
burning oil-lamps before the statues. The latter were
apparently votive in character, and they seem to have
performed the religious obligations required of the
people whom they represented, to have actually offered
the prayers inscribed on their lifeless bodies, and, in
short, to have played the noble part of a vicarious worshipper.
Without doubt this is the real explanation of
the devotional attitude displayed by Gudea in his
statues. Magic and divination, the ever-ready handmaids
of all primitive religions, were cultivated and
fervently believed in at this period as in later times,
prophets, seers, and dream-interpreters being almost as
much in demand as they are to-day.</p>

<p>A special order of priests was appointed to take funerals
and perform the necessary rites and ceremonies, and
they received fees or honoraria for their services. The
dead required sustenance in the grave, and it was customary
to place seven jars of liquor and four hundred
and twenty loaves of bread beside the corpse; this
custom had become virtually binding and obligatory
upon the unfortunate relations of the deceased, and one
of Urukagina&#8217;s reforms was the reduction of these dues.</p>

<p>The temples themselves, which sometimes stood in
their own grounds and were surrounded by a sacred
wood, were enriched with statues, vases, inscribed slabs,
treasures of silver and precious stones, and luxuries of
all kinds.</p>

<p>The actual and inward piety of the people of Lagash,
as of the Babylonians and Assyrians of a later period is
evinced in the divinely-compounded names which they
bore, names which were clearly intended to secure the
assistance and favour of the god whose earthly namesakes
they were, and in whose honour these names were
compounded. Thus the designation of one individual
<a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 375</span>is &#8220;En-lil is my defence,&#8221; of another, &#8220;Bau is my
mother,&#8221; and of a third &#8220;Enki is my companion,&#8221; names
which vividly recall some of the proper names in the Old
Testament. Another striking testimony to the reality
of what may be termed the individual religion of those
days, is the prevailing belief in the beneficence of one
particular god towards oneself; it is clear that the personal
element in the religious feelings and aspirations of
the times was not satisfied by the oblations and ceremonies
of the official cults, but sought and presumably
found satisfaction in the comforting belief that some one
god really understood the peculiar circumstances, difficulties
and perplexities of the aspirant, and, understanding,
might be counted upon to render help in time of need.</p>

<h3>(<i>B</i>) THE KHAMMURABI PERIOD</h3>

<h4>1. <i>LAWS, MANNERS AND CUSTOMS</i></h4>

<p>The reign of Khammurabi is in some respects the
half-way house in the history of Mesopotamian civilization.
The king was of course the supreme head of the
state, and indeed he was not only &#8220;the first gentleman&#8221;
in Babylonia, but also enjoyed the unique privilege and
blessing of being a demigod. The deification of kings
was a practice in vogue centuries before the time of
Khammurabi, and it was doubtless a practice assiduously
cultivated by the kings themselves. Some of the
early Semite kings of Kish were deified after death,
while the name of Shar-Gâni-sharri of Agade is often
written with the divine determinative, and the name of
his son Narâm-Sin is hardly ever written without it.
But during the later dynasty of Ur the practice grew
up of deifying the king while still alive, instead of waiting
for him to take his seat on the bench of gods after
death. Of Khammurabi&#8217;s divine nature we have evidence
in the use of such names as &#8220;Khammurabi-ilu&#8221;
(==Khammurabi is god), as well as in the frequent
coupling of his name with those of the gods in oaths.</p>

<p><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 376</span></p>

<p>After the king, but a long way after, come the nobility
and gentry, a class which not only comprehended
the men of high birth but also those who, though artisans,
had the distinction of belonging to old trade
guilds, among which may be mentioned carpenters,
tailors, builders, or potters. Next came what may be
termed the lower middle classes, while at the bottom
rung of the ladder&#8212;if indeed he can correctly be said
to have been on the ladder at all&#8212;was the slave,
who was nothing more than a piece of goods or a
chattel.</p>

<p>The full extent of Khammurabi&#8217;s empire is not
known, but his claim to immortality rests not on the
ever-shifting sands of territorial aggrandizement, but on
the solid rock of moral progress. To form an accurate
estimate of the influence which Khammurabi&#8217;s code of
laws has had on the Mosaic code and indirectly on the
European codes of to-day is beyond our power, but one
fact is indisputable, and that is that the legal code of
Khammurabi some four thousand years ago enshrines
many of those principles of justice and mercy which we
are apt to regard as the peculiar offspring of our own
enlightened age.</p>

<p>Many however of the laws embraced in this world-famed
code show little or no variation from those in force
if not actually systematized in the time of Urukagina.
The laws relating to marriage are almost a replica of
those which obtained among the early Sumerians, the
contract being still made between the suitor and the
father of the prospective bride, to whom he normally
paid a price for his daughter&#8217;s hand, the price
of course varying according to the station in life of the
parties concerned. The sum given to the father was
often handed over by him to his daughter, but if no
children were born of the marriage the man was entitled
to receive back the price he had paid for his wife on her
death, if it had not been returned to him previously.
<a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 377</span>The father in his turn usually gave his daughter a dowry
or marriage-portion, which on her death reverted to the
family in the event of her having no children. The
dowries often comprised various kinds of property including
gold and silver, slaves, furniture and apparel,
and generally appear to have exceeded in value the marriage-price
paid by the husband. If children born of
the marriage survived the wife, her dowry was divided
amongst them. Even if the woman was divorced she
retained her marriage-portion, though it was forfeited
in the event of gross moral misconduct on her part. In
the eyes of the law a married man and woman were one,
each being held accountable for the other&#8217;s debts, not
excepting even prenuptial liabilities. But though the
Babylonian of Khammurabi&#8217;s day, as in the time of Urukagina,
was apparently a monogamist, he was permitted
to have a concubine in the event of his wife not providing
him with an heir, the children of the concubine being
regarded as legitimate, and the concubine being entitled
to all the respect and consideration due to a wife. There
are various clauses in the code dealing with special cases,
such as the marriage of a free woman with a slave, or the
marriage of votaries, but for a detailed account of these,
reference must be made to the standard works on the
Khammurabi Code, among which may be specially mentioned
Harper&#8217;s <i>Code of Hammurabi</i><a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> and John&#8217;s translation
of the code in his <i>Babylonian and Assyrian Laws,
Contracts and Letters</i>.</p>

<p>As in the earlier period, the Babylonians of Khammurabi&#8217;s
day were essentially an agricultural people, but
since the time of Urukagina, agriculture had developed
enormously, and the relationship of landlord to tenant,
and of employer to labourer, was regulated and fixed
by a number of legal enactments embodied in the code.</p>

<p><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 378</span></p>

<p>Ordinary arable land was let at a fixed rental, the rent
being paid in corn, but the owner was entitled to a deposit,
and non-payment of the rent was a legal debt. The
code contains two special provisions, the effect of which
must have been to make the tenant postpone the payment
of his rent as long as possible. The one enacted
that if the rent had not been paid, or if the land had been
lent on the share-profit principle and the crops were destroyed
by a storm, the damage done was shared either
equally or proportionally by landlord and tenant. If
on the other hand the rent had been already paid, the
tenant could claim no compensation. The share-profit
system was very common, and in such cases the landlord
generally received a half or two-thirds of the crop. But
the inequalities calculated to arise from such a system
were obvious, for though it safeguarded the tenant to
some extent, it left the landlord without remedy in the
event of his tenant being an idler, and to provide for
such a case a clause was inserted to the effect that the
negligent small owner should pay an average rent &#8220;like
his neighbours.&#8221; Often the landlord further secured
himself by stipulating in the contract for the erection of
a cottage on the land, or insisted on the tenant renting a
cottage already built there, the cottage to be vacated on
the termination of the lease.</p>

<p>The tenant was empowered to sub-let his ground,
the principal landlord&#8217;s consent apparently not being
necessary. The landlord was of course legally entitled
to the rent agreed upon in the contract with his immediate
tenant, but provided that was forthcoming, and
the ground properly cultivated, he could raise no objection.
Sometimes the landlord found the seed, the
necessary tools, and also the oxen, and in addition paid
a wage to the farmer; in this case the status of the
tenant somewhat resembled that of a gardener in his
cottage on an estate to-day. The seed, the oxen, and
everything belonged to his master, and the penalty for
<a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 379</span>any embezzlement of the same on the part of the tenant
was the amputation of the latter&#8217;s hands. Again, if a
tenant of this kind were a rogue, he might hire out the
oxen, purloin the provender he had received from his
master for the said oxen, and at the same time produce
no crop: in this case he was liable to a heavy fine, and
if he were insolvent, he was torn to pieces by the oxen
on the field which he had neglected to cultivate.</p>

<p>The laws and regulations which applied to agricultural
land-tenure, applied for the most part to the leasing
of plantations and gardens as well. Thanks to the
extraordinary fertility of Babylonian soil the owners of
land became very wealthy; this notwithstanding, the
money-lender was not without clients. Unforeseen disasters
occurred, which crippled the landowner, and but
for the money-lender he would not be able to tide over
the trouble. As security for the loan he frequently mortgaged
his land, but the code enacted that he should at all
times reap the crop himself, and pay off the debt and the
money-lender&#8217;s expenses from the produce. Moreover
the money-lender was legally bound to accept such produce
or corn in settlement of the debt, and could not insist
on being paid in money, unless, as was frequently the
case, he had stipulated in the contract that the loan was
to be repaid in the same form as that in which it had
been received. As a further safeguard for the unfortunate
money-borrower it was made illegal to exercise distraint
for rent or anything else upon a working ox. This
was a humane law, for the watering of the ground, as
well as the ploughing of the soil and the threshing of the
wheat, was largely done by oxen.</p>

<p>The laws regulating the irrigation of the land were
stringent owing to the disastrous consequences resulting
from negligence on the part of any concerned.
Once the canals had been made, it was the bounden duty
of each landowner, whether small or great, to keep that
part of the canal which passed by or through his land
<a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 380</span>in good repair. If that part of the bank of the canal for
which he was responsible gave way, and the water thereby
flooded his neighbour&#8217;s land, he had to pay damages
in full, and if he were insolvent he could be sold up.
He was entitled to open a runnel to water his field, but
if the water swamped the adjoining fields through some
inadvertence or negligence on his part, he had to give
full compensation.</p>

<p>The wages, presumably the minimum wage of the
labourer, was fixed by law, as also was the hire-price of
oxen and wagons. The hirer of animals was under a
legal obligation to take proper care of them, and omission
to do so involved a penalty. But if an accident
occurred which the hirer could not be expected to foresee
or prevent&#8212;such as an attack by a lion&#8212;the owner
had to bear the loss. This was also the case if the person
in charge of the animal was a shepherd or herdsman
in the owner&#8217;s employ, the principle being the same
in both cases. Wilful negligence was not to be condoned,
but on the other hand, the consequence of unforeseen
and unavoidable accidents was not to be visited upon
either hirer or employee.</p>

<p>The larger half of the working population in Khammurabi&#8217;s
time were probably engaged in agricultural pursuits
while the remainder were occupied in trade or commerce.
Now the expansion of trade depends upon the existence
of an adequate means of transport, whereby exports can
go out and imports come in. Before the invention and
introduction of locomotives, water was the unrivalled
medium for conveying large quantities of goods from
one place to another, and even to-day with our interlacing
networks of railways we still find use for the canals of
primitive days. It was undoubtedly the two rivers, the
Tigris and the Euphrates, that were accountable for the
development of the trading faculty of the Babylonians,
a faculty which ultimately made them the great commercial
people of the Oriental world. We are accordingly
<a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 381</span>not surprised to find that already, even in the time of
Khammurabi, shipping was an important trade. A sure
and certain indication of this fact is to be found in the
number of laws directly concerning ship-builders and
boatmen in the Code. The ship-builder, or rather the
boat-builder,&#8212;for ships properly so-called were a very
much later invention,&#8212;was absolutely responsible for
his workmanship, and was required to give a year&#8217;s
guarantee to the purchaser; if it proved faulty during
that time he had to provide another. As in the case of
the agricultural labourer,the hired boatman was responsible
for the boat and cargo in his charge, and any negligence
on his part was penal. If a ship collided with
another ship riding at anchor, the colliding ship was
liable for all damages.</p>

<p>Business was carried on largely by means of agents
as it is with us to-day. The agent gave a receipt for
the goods or money he received from his chief, and then
went off to trade with them. The agent generally appears
to have received an ordinary commission, which
on his return he was expected to repay with a reasonable
profit, the profit sometimes being a definitely fixed sum,
at others, a prearranged share of the actual proceeds.
As in our own day, some merchants were speculators,
and all the uncertainty incidental to any kind of speculation
seems to have surrounded the prospects of the
agent, who doubtless at times scored well, while on
other occasions he lost heavily. But any loss resulting
from an untoward event which the agent could neither
foresee nor prevent, had to be borne by the merchant.
Thus if an agent were robbed in the course of his travels,
he could clear himself from all liability in the matter by
taking an oath to that effect. But this law might clearly
lead to sharp practice on the part of a dishonest agent;
and accordingly any false claims on his part had to be repaid
threefold, but a false claim by a chief in regard to
the goods entrusted to his agent had to be repaid sixfold.
<a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 382</span>All business transactions had to be drawn up in
writing to make them legal.</p>

<p>The obvious advantages of partnership were soon
recognized by the commercially sagacious Babylonians,
and business-partnerships were well known in the time
of Khammurabi. In arriving at the dividends, the usual
arrangement was for the partners to withdraw their capital
and interest, and then receive equal shares of the
superfluous profits. The dividends were made yearly
and the withdrawal by each partner of his capital virtually
dissolved the partnership, which could of course
be renewed from time to time if desired.</p>

<p>As in all commercial enterprises, capital was the one
essential, and the need of immediate cash was supplied
by the money-lender. The rate of interest charged in
Khammurabi&#8217;s time is not known, but the rate charged
on loans of corn was often as much as forty per cent.
Such loans were however generally in demand at seed-time,
and if repaid at harvest, no interest seems to have
been charged. A debtor could repay his loan either in
the form of corn or sesame, and the value of each was
fixed by law. If a debtor was insolvent, he could hand
over a servant to his creditor to work off the debt which
was due. The ownership of such a servant was, however,
still vested in the debtor, and the servant was protected
by law against maltreatment at the hand of the
creditor. If he were a free man, the creditor had to
restore him to his original master at the termination of
three years, and the same rule applied if a wife or child
of the debtor were the pledge or surety.</p>

<p>Distraint was not unknown, but it was the last expedient
which the creditor was entitled to adopt after all other
means had failed. Distraint on corn without the previous
consent of the debtor was illegal, and illegal distraint
<i>ipso facto</i> forfeited the right of any further claim
on the part of the creditor, while the execution of a distraint
where no claim had been substantiated was penal,
<a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 383</span>and the theoretical creditor had to pay a fine. As before-mentioned
no distraint could be levied on a working-ox,
and indeed distraint of any kind could apparently only
be issued subsequently to the consent of the debtor. In
short, the interests of the humbler and poorer members
of the community were safeguarded in every way possible.
Not only were the small farmers protected, but
even the working-classes received the attention of the
legislators of Khammurabi&#8217;s time. Thus at harvest-time
there was evidently a tendency to put up the price of
beer, and accordingly a clause in the code enacts that
drink was to be sold at a cheap rate in spite of the increased
demand.</p>

<p>Again, everyone in the community is practically at
the mercy of the housebuilder, and accordingly any
damage caused by the use of faulty materials or bad
workmanship, had to be made good by the builder. If
the house collapsed and the owner was killed, the builder
was put to death, while if the owner&#8217;s son or servant was
killed, the son or servant of the builder was similarly
put to death, in accordance with the primitive law of
retaliation. House-tenure in the time of Khammurabi
was generally on the repairing-lease system, the
tenant being required to leave the house in the same
condition in which he found it, while it was customary
to pay rent half-yearly instead of quarterly, the rent being
paid in advance.</p>

<p>The ultimate sanction and enforcement of these various
laws concerning the relationship subsisting between
capitalist and workman, owner and hirer, and landlord
and tenant, was to be found in the courts. Strange to
say, the chief scene of jurisdiction was the temple, the
god himself adjudicating through the mediumship of
his earthly plenipotentiaries. The precise form of legal
procedure in the time of Khammurabi is not known,
but certain facts in regard to the institution and conduct
of suits have been elucidated.</p>

<p><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 384</span></p>

<p>One great difference between law-suits in the time
of Khammurabi and those of our own day was that the
cases were not apparently conducted by counsel, but by
the parties themselves, an arrangement which must have
considerably accrued to the advantage of the abler of
the two suitors. The more important cases were heard
by a bench of judges somewhat resembling our Court
of Appeal, while the minor suits were heard by a single
judge, as in our High Courts and County Courts. The
plea had to be set down in writing in the form of an
&#8220;affidavit&#8221;; whether the defendant was able to file a
counter-affidavit does not seem quite clear. At the trial
itself the plaintiff and defendant both summoned their
witnesses, and the judgment was signed by both parties.
Appeal to a higher court was the only remedy for the
loser of the suit, the judge in the lower court not being
allowed to hear the same case a second time under pain
of being struck off the list, and at the same time mulcted
for twelve times the amount of the fine he had previously
ordered, or the damages he had assessed.</p>

<p>The date of the trial was fixed by the judge, but it
had to be within six months of the filing of the affidavit.
This time was allowed in order to enable the
plaintiff to procure his witnesses in the event of their
being absent from home. The appointment of the
judges, or at least of some of them, was vested in the
crown; whether they were paid or not is a matter of
doubt. Sometimes judgeships were hereditary. But
whether judges received fees or not they appear to have
been regarded as professional men and retained their
title even after they had ceased to exercise their judicial
functions. The supreme judge was the king himself,
to whom cases of primary importance were occasionally
referred, while the principal officers of state often
acted as judges.</p>

<p>The following crimes were capital offences, though
the precise form in which the death sentence was to
<a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 385</span>be carried out is not always quite clear:&#8212;a false
accusation of witchcraft; perjury on the part of a
witness in a capital case; burglary of a temple, palace,
or private house; kidnapping a free-born child; highway
robbery; theft of the goods of a man whose house
is on fire; adultery; various forms of incest; rape of
a betrothed maiden; persuading a slave to flee from
his master, or being an accessory after the fact by harbouring
him; various forms of theft and fraud; and
building a house so badly that it collapsed and thereby
killed the owner. The penalty of death appears to have
been inflicted either by burning, impalement, dismemberment,
or drowning.</p>

<p>Criminal offences of a less serious character were
treated differently. Among the penalties enumerated in
the code, mutilation, branding and scourging are the most
barbarous. Mutilation was a punishment based logically
on the &#8220;eye for an eye,&#8221; and &#8220;tooth for a tooth&#8221;
principle, its application being primarily to those who
had mutilated their neighbour. But its application was
extended to cover other forms of crime or offences adjudged
in those days as crimes, thus insolence on the part
of an adopted child to his foster-parents was effectually
stopped by the removal of the child&#8217;s tongue; while an
adopted son who is unduly inquisitive into the origin
of his birth has his eye plucked out; lastly&#8212;and
what perhaps to us seems the most amazing of all&#8212;if
a surgeon performed an operation and the patient died
through any carelessness or lack of skill on his part, the
surgeon&#8217;s hands were amputated&#8212;a law which must
have considerably cooled the ardour of any of the surgeons
of those days particularly addicted to the use
of the knife. Branding was the outward and visible
sign (usually imprinted on the arm) of degradation to
slavery,&#8212;the punishment for slandering a votary or a
married woman. Scourging was the penalty for striking
a superior; the scourging was to be performed in
<a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 386</span>public, the strokes numbering sixty, and the implement
used a cow-hide whip; while banishment from the city
was the very fitting and meet punishment for incest.</p>

<h4>2. <i>RELIGION</i></h4>

<p>The one outstanding feature of the Babylonian religion
of Khammurabi&#8217;s time was the unique position
assigned to Marduk in the Babylonian pantheon. Marduk
owed his exaltation to what we may without undue
levity call local interest. The dynasty of which Khammurabi
was so illustrious a monarch was the first dynasty
of the city of Babylon itself; and Marduk the
local god of Babylon naturally shared in the good fortune
and prosperity of the people over whose welfare
he presided. To Marduk belonged the real credit,
honour and glory of his people&#8217;s success, what wonder
then that he should be accorded the post of honour in
the hierarchy of heaven! Other gods indeed existed,
and received such attention as befitted their inferior
position, but their light was as that of a planet compared
with the dazzling radiance of the midday sun,
while a monotheistic tendency sprang up, fostered by
a desire to attribute to Marduk such marvellous performances
as the creation of the world, performances
which had hitherto been ascribed to the older gods of
Southern Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>But reverence and respect for the traditions of a
heroic past precluded the possibility of dishonouring
the gods who had made that past so glorious, and the
only way to satisfy the religious aspirations of Marduk&#8217;s
devotees on the one hand, and maintain the loyalty due
to the time-honoured gods of Babylonian infancy on
the other, was to identify the latter with Marduk; had
this process of identification been carried to its logical
conclusion it would have resulted in the evolution of
a monotheism as exclusive and as simple as the most
dogmatic Unitarianism of to-day.</p>

<p><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 387</span></p>

<p>Fortunately or unfortunately such was not the case;
the practical sequence of the tendency was realized in
the identification of Marduk with the ancient god of
Nippur, but apart from that, the tendency remained a
tendency and nothing more. Notwithstanding this fact
however, Marduk&#8217;s supremacy was so firmly established,
and his position so impregnably secured, that the passing
changes and chances of some two thousand years
were unable to oust him from his high estate, and it is
to Marduk that Cyrus, the vanquisher of Babylon&#8217;s last
native king, and the fated heir to her evanescent empire,
ascribes the triumphant victory which attended
his arms. He recorded the acknowledgment of his obligations
to the lord of E-sagil on a clay cylinder now
preserved in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The inscription is written in cuneiform characters,
and states that Marduk &#8220;sought out a righteous prince,
a man after his own heart whom he might take by the
hand, and he called his name Cyrus. And Marduk the
great lord, the protector of his people, beheld his good
deeds and his righteous heart with joy.&#8221; Thus 1500
years after the time of Khammurabi, the cult of Marduk
was still intimately bound up with the prosperity
of his people, and it was owing to the neglect of his
worship and to the mal-preservation of his fanes that
Nabonidus the last king of the Neo-Babylonian dynasty
was unable to withstand the onslaughts of a foreign
conqueror.</p>

<p>Although Marduk was thus the supreme god of Babylon,
to whose shrine all true patriots were wont to resort,
other gods were still the subjects of veneration, and it
was still thought prudent to seek their favour and assistance.
The sun continued to pursue the even tenor of
his way, and after all, the sun is an important factor in
the manifold operations of agriculture, it therefore behoves
man to pay his respects to a god whose mere
momentary absence behind a cloud of displeasure may
<a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 388</span>bring about such momentous consequences. Among
other deities worshipped at this time, mention should
be made of Ishtar, the mother of the gods, and the goddess
of love and war, Anu the lord of heaven, and Ea
the god of the deep, of Sin the moon-god and the specific
patron of the people of Ur, of Ninib the god of war, and
Adad the weather deity.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p>The great religious movement which characterized
the establishment of the first dynasty of Babylon, naturally
brought in its train all the paraphernalia required
by and incidental to a highly-organized state religion.
The priesthood became a power, and the temples commercial
centres as well as seats of learning. The revenue
of the temple was very large; its principal source seems
to have been the endowments and royal bounties of
the kings. As in earlier times, it owned a large number
of cattle and sheep, and the administration of its
property seems to have caused Khammurabi a considerable
amount of anxiety. A great many priests and laymen
were attached to the service of the temple, and the
spiritual labourer of those days seems to have deserved
an altogether exorbitant hire. It was clearly a most
profitable concern, and the privilege of serving in the
temple was a positive asset which could be bought, sold,
or mortgaged. This valuable privilege which brought
such pecuniary advantages with it, was, needless to say,
very jealously guarded by the elect, who firmly adhered
to the hereditary principle&#8212;then in full swing. These
privileges were in fact inalienable and were transmitted
from father to son.</p>

<p>The financial prosperity of the temple and its attachés
is shown by their opening their doors for financial business
pure and simple, money-lending in time becoming
quite an important branch of the temple work. The
loans however seem to have generally been free loans,
no interest being exacted.</p>

<p><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 389</span></p>

<p>But the temple had its obligations to perform as well
as its privileges to enjoy, one of the duties incumbent
upon the temple authorities being the ransoming of a
fellow townsman who had been taken prisoner by the
enemy.</p>

<h3>(<i>C</i>) THE ASSYRIAN ERA</h3>

<h4>1. <i>STATE OF SOCIETY</i></h4>

<p>In Assyrian times the same explicit or implicit regulations
in regard to the family seem to have been in force,
or tacitly agreed to, as those which obtained in the older
Babylonian period. Apparently a man was only expected
in the normal way to marry one woman, though it seems
probable that in the event of the first wife proving childless
it was regarded as quite justifiable and legitimate for
a man to take to himself another woman, in view of the
desirability of his having an heir.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> Accordingly monogamy
seems to have been the general rule, though polygamy
was by no means unknown. When a man married,
he left his father and mother and was expected to
&#8220;cleave&#8221; unto his wife, and they became &#8220;one flesh&#8221;
and inhabited &#8220;one house&#8221;; in short, the Assyrian
&#8220;home&#8221; was normally the same as the English &#8220;home&#8221;
of to-day. As in the time of Khammurabi, women could
be legal owners of property, and often owned farms and
occupied vineyards.</p>

<p>The general pursuits of the people were much the
same as those followed by the earlier inhabitants of Mesopotamia.
The population was, as then, largely agricultural;
the land required the same careful and elaborate
irrigation while the ground had to be ploughed, the seed
sown, and the harvest reaped as heretofore. A corn-land
holding<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> usually had a house attached to it, and also a
court where the corn was stored, which thus served
the purpose, if not resembling the appearance, of a barn.
A large number of people were evidently employed in
<a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 390</span>the vineyards, which must sometimes have been very
extensive, for the number of plants in a single vineyard
in one case was as many as 49,300, and it is a
significant fact that the most celebrated wines in Babylonia
came from the north, while it is also worth noting
the frequency with which the vine occurs on Assyrian
bas-reliefs. Orchards and gardens also abounded, though
what grew in them is to some extent a matter of conjecture;
if however we may assume that the list of plants
mentioned in the Babylonian <i>Garden Tablet</i> published
by Meissner, holds good also for the Assyrian garden,
leek, onion, garlic, lettuce, coriander, hyssop, turnip,
cabbage, and radish must have been familiar garden
products.</p>

<p>Cattle and sheep were reared as in the old days, the
latter both for their wool and also for food, while goats
provided milk, as well as meat and hair, goat&#8217;s hair
being used even to-day in the East for the coverings of
tents. Oxen were used largely for working the irrigation
machines, while asses also served as beasts of labour.
The camel was not unknown, and is often named in connection
with the sales of estates. The horse at this period
was in common use, but was seemingly reserved for
riding and driving.</p>

<p>The legal paraphernalia of Assyrian times was the
natural development of the Babylonian law code of
which it was the off-shoot. In the ownership of land
the hereditary principle seems to have been the dominating
factor, and probably farms and vineyards passed
automatically from father to son in the same way as
crown lands and larger estates. The peasant was still
a serf, bought or sold with the land to which fate had
attached him; he was not permitted to migrate elsewhere,
but on the other hand he was under the protection
of the state; he could not be ousted by invaders,
and his living was a first charge on the estate. It is
certain that estate-slaves were sometimes requisitioned
<a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 391</span>for military or other state purposes, the owner being
of course compelled to meet the demand, while the
produce of his land was also subject to taxation. Some
estates were however exempt from dues of this kind,
the exemption doubtless being granted by the royal
favour and confirmed by royal charter.</p>

<p>Among the smaller land-owners we find a number
of farmers or vine-owners who have forsaken business
or industrial pursuits, and have left the bakery and the
scribe&#8217;s office to return to the soil.</p>

<p>The landlord frequently did not reside on his land,
but let it out to tenants, whom he expected to pay rent
in due season. The original ownership of land was no
doubt largely if not entirely the gift of the king, while
conquests would continually place fresh tracts of land in
his hands. Probably some of the newly acquired property
went to swell the extent of the crown lands, while
the rest or part of the rest was distributed among the
king&#8217;s ministers, generals and other court favourites.</p>

<h4>2. <i>RELIGION</i></h4>

<p>The Assyrian religion was Babylonian both in origin
and character. Anu, Bel, and Ea, Marduk, Nergal,
Adad, Shamash and Sin, Nanâ and Ishtar were all held
in esteem, and temples were erected in their honour.
The supremacy of Assyria and the corresponding decline
in Babylonian power scarcely affected the authority and
influence of the time-honoured gods of the Babylonian
pantheon. But the new political situation required some
recognition in the religious life of the nation, and the
exigencies of the present demanded some consideration,
as well as the hallowed traditions of the past. These
two conflicting interests had to be reconciled, and the
reconciliation was effected and a way of escape devised
similar to that adopted by the earlier Babylonians when
confronted with a like dilemma. The local god of Ashur
was exalted to the first place in the pantheon, and became
<a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 392</span>as it were the Marduk of Assyria, though his position
was even more unassailable than was that of Marduk
in Babylon, for the latter<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> was bound to acknowledge
Ea as his father, whereas Ashur is above all ties
of this kind; the Babylonian-Assyrian pantheon is
recognized by him, but it in no way touches his lofty
estate.</p>

<p>The cult of the god of Ashur goes back to the earliest
known period of Assyrian civilization, while he gave
his name to the first known capital of the country,
and ultimately to the country itself. Ashur is the divine
impersonation of Assyria, as Marduk was of Babylonia,
only the identification was more pronounced, for the
decline of Assyrian power and the death of her empire
meant virtually the death of Ashur, whereas Marduk
maintained his influence during the time of Babylon&#8217;s
adversity as well as during that of her prosperity;
foreign conquerors sought to do him honour, Cyrus the
Persian ascribes his conquest of Babylon to the lord of
E-sagil, and even Antiochus Soter (280-260<span class="smcap lowercase"> B.C.</span>) restores
his renowned temple. But another difference
between the Ashur-cult of the north and the Marduk-cult
of the south must also be noted. Ashur was worshipped
in temples erected all over the Assyrian empire,
whereas Babylon was the place &#8220;where men ought to
worship&#8221; Marduk, just as in later times Jerusalem was
the only authorized centre for the worship of Jehovah.
But in spite of the universality of his presence, Ashur
had a principal seat of worship, the locality of which was
the same as that of the then centre and capital of the empire,
Ashur, Calah, Nineveh or Khorsabad as the case
might be.</p>

<p>The adaptability displayed by Ashur in regard to his
earthly home may, as Jastrow suggests, be partly due to
the fact that a statue was not the only, or even the principal
symbol of his divine presence, as was the case with
<a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 393</span>Marduk and the other great gods. His usual emblem was
a standard consisting of a pole surrounded by a winged
disc to which is attached an archer with drawn bow. It is
impossible to say the exact time when a military standard
came to be regarded as the natural and fitting symbol of
the patron god of the country, but the nature of the symbol
itself makes it quite clear that Ashur was regarded
as a god of war. Indeed the patron deity of a people
as warlike as the Assyrians, could not but reflect the
military spirit of his people. The Assyrian warriors
were the &#8220;troops of Ashur,&#8221; their enemies being his
enemies and their friends his friends. Ashur&#8217;s spouse
was B[=e]lit (==&#8220;the Lady&#8221;), but the same goddess sometimes
appears as the consort of Bel<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> and sometimes also
as the wife of Ea, in the Assyrian inscriptions, while at
other times again B[=e]lit is merely a designation of Ishtar.
The last-named goddess occupies a very prominent place
in the Assyrian pantheon, only coming second to Ashur
himself. There were indeed no less than three Ishtars
in Assyria&#8212;Ishtar of Nineveh, Ishtar of Arbela, and
Ishtar of Kidmuru, but the Assyrians do not appear to
have preserved any definite distinction between them,
so that for all practical purposes we only have one
goddess to consider in this connection.</p>

<p>It is hardly to be wondered at that Ishtar, the goddess
of war as well as of love, should have been held in high
reverence by the Assyrians, who not unnaturally accentuated
her warlike attributes. But the Assyrians were
not responsible for the origin of Ishtar&#8217;s warlike
character; she had been regarded in this light at least
as early as the time of Khammurabi,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> while her fighting
spirit is strongly painted in the early Gilgamesh epic,
but it remained for the Assyrians to develop this aspect
of her character to the virtual exclusion of all other
aspects. As the Assyrians extended their sway on every
side, the power of Ishtar the <i>B[=e]lit</i>, or &#8220;lady&#8221; of battles,
<a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 394</span>advanced also; she is the goddess of kings and people
alike; in times of danger she vouchsafes her counsel
and her timely words of encouragement to the king
through the medium of dreams. She is &#8220;perfect in
courage&#8221; and incomparable in splendour; her appearance
is like unto flames of fire, and she rains streams of
fire upon the enemies of Ashur-bani-pal. Unlike other
goddesses she reigns in her own right, and not in virtue
of her position as the spouse, counterpart, or reflection
of any of the important gods. She is their equal in rank,
power and dignity, while her very name becomes almost
a synonym for &#8220;goddess,&#8221; and in later times all goddesses,
whether native or foreign, came to be regarded
as so many forms or manifestations of Ishtar.</p>

<p>But apart from the advancement to honour of the warlike
deities of Babylonia, and the further development of
the military character which they already bore, the Assyrian
religion varies but little from that of the mother-country.
The civilization and culture of the Assyrians
was imported <i>en bloc</i> from Babylonia, and this wholesale
appropriation of the manners and customs of the people
of the south displays itself in Assyrian art, religion, law
and architecture. Their temples and palaces were more
or less faithful copies of those erected in Babylonia; their
beliefs, rites and ceremonies were derived from the same
source, while their literature shows hardly any originality
at all. When Ashur-bani-pal resolved to collect a
library in his royal palace at Nineveh he was obliged to
dispatch his scribes to the south to make search in the
archives of the ancient temples which contained the
prayers and hymns addressed to the gods, the legends
and epics of the remote past, the astronomical reports
and medical formulæ of the immediate present. A large
part of Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s library consisted in practically
verbatim copies of these original texts, but the debt
which we owe to Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s bibliographical propensities
must not be measured by the originality of the
<a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 395</span>volumes of his library, but by the large contribution
which they make to the Babylonian and Assyrian literature
now at our disposal. In a great many cases the
Babylonian originals have not been recovered, and we
are entirely dependent on the copies of Ashur-bani-pal&#8217;s
scribes, and but for this great king&#8217;s assiduity in this
direction we should be in entire ignorance regarding
the contents of a large part of the Babylono-Assyrian
literature.</p>

<h3>(<i>D</i>) BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN SYMBOLISM</h3>

<p>In all religions, whether ancient or modern, material
representation forms the connecting link between the
natural and the supernatural, the physical and the spiritual.
The medium sometimes assumes the shape of an
image of a naturally or unnaturally conceived deity, at
other times it takes the form of an emblem, astronomical
or otherwise, with which the god is associated. We have
had abundant evidence of the prominent part played by
images in the worship of the Babylonians and Assyrians,
and it will perhaps not be unfitting to devote two or
three pages to a brief consideration of some of the emblems
of the deities to whom reference has been made.</p>

<p>The chief sources for the study of Assyrian and Babylonian
symbolism are the cylinder-seals, the Babylonian
Boundary-Stones, and the monoliths of Assyrian kings.
In a brief review of Mesopotamian cylinder-seals we
have had occasion to observe the frequent occurrence of
emblems, many of which are also found on the monoliths
of Assyrian kings, e.g. Sargon, Sennacherib and
Esarhaddon. Among those of which the signification
is certain we may mention the crescent, obviously emblematic
of the Moon-god Sin, and the star of Ishtar,
while the deity armed with thunderbolts is certainly
Adad. The winged disc which occurs on a stele of
Esarhaddon, as well as on other Assyrian monuments,
is clearly symbolic of Ashur, though in earlier times it
<a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 396</span>apparently emblematized Shamash, the Sun-god,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> and if
this be the case we have a useful piece of evidence in
support of the theory of a solar origin for Ashur.</p>

<table summary="Figs. 114, 115"><tr>

<p>But the Babylonian <i>kudurrus</i> or boundary-stones provide
far more material for the study of Babylonian symbolism
than do the Assyrian royal sculptures, for the emblems
of the gods, as well as the gods themselves, were
for the most part borrowed from Babylonia and adopted
with variations by the people of the north. We have the
emblems which are scattered about sporadically on the
Babylonian cylinder-seals collected together in more or
less large groups on the boundary stones. On one of
these boundary stones (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig113">113</a>) the name of the god
with whom the emblem is associated is inscribed by the
side, thus giving us definite data instead of hypothetical
conjecture upon which to base our investigation. Unfortunately
all the names inscribed on this kudurru are
not legible, but among those which are certain, the following
should be noted: Shamash the Sun-god who is
represented by a circle within which are four rays of
light alternating with four streams of water. Ishtar is
represented by a star, and Sin the Moon-god by a crescent
as usual. Ea is symbolized by a ram&#8217;s head on a
column, the column being set on a rectangular throne
beneath which lies the fish-tailed capricorn. Marduk is
represented likewise by a column, the top of which however
<a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 397</span>is shaped like a lance. Nergal, the god of the dead,
is symbolized by a lion-headed column, while the seated
goddess is Gula, who has been identified with Bau.</p>

<p>Another important monument in this connection is
the rock-relief of Sennacherib near Bavian (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig114">114</a>).
The inscription mentions twelve gods, and the same number
of emblems, presumably corresponding to the twelve
gods, are sculptured on the rock. But the important point
is that not only does the number of emblems portrayed
tally with the number of gods mentioned, but there are
definite indications that the order of sequence is the same
in both cases.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> Thus the crescent which obviously symbolizes
the moon-god occurs fifth, the same place occupied
by Sin in the list of names. Again, the star, the
undoubted emblem of Ishtar, similarly comes eleventh,
the name of the goddess also being eleventh in the list.
Lastly, the thunderbolt, which is the certain symbol of
Adad, occupies the seventh place and corresponds with
that occupied by the god in the inscription. These
three coincidences can hardly be regarded as accidental,
and it is reasonable to assign the remaining symbols to
the corresponding gods in the list. Following out this
method we can provisionally assign the emblems as follows:
Ashur, Anu and Bel are represented by horned
hats; Ea by a column with a ram&#8217;s head; Sin by a
crescent; Shamash by a winged disc; Adad by a thunderbolt;
Marduk by a column with a pine-apple termination;
Nabû by a simple column; Ninib (?) by a column
surmounted by two lions&#8217; (or two bulls&#8217;) heads; Ishtar
by a star; and Igigi by seven dots.</p>

<p>Probably the finest specimen of a Babylonian stele of
this character is that of Nebuchadnezzar I (<i>circ.</i> <span class="smcap">1120
B.C.</span>) (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig115">115</a>). In the upper register we have the
crescent, disc and star of Sin, Shamash and Ishtar respectively,
the second register being occupied with a
row of three emblems each consisting in a divine seat
<a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 398</span>surmounted by a horned turban. The last-named seemingly
represent Anu, Bel and either Ashur or Ea.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> Next
in succession we appear to have the emblems of Marduk
and Nebo, while in the fourth register we have the
double-headed column of Ninib, a horse&#8217;s head resting
on a seat and surmounted by a vaulted arch, (this is
<span class="figleft150" style="width: 150px;"><a name="fig115" id="fig115" />
<img src="images/fig115.jpg" width="150" height="322" alt="Fig. 115." />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 115.</span></span></span>
of particular interest, as according to
Ward, it is probably the earliest representation
of the horse in Babylonian
art); an eagle on the top of a column,
and another column surmounted by a
hawk&#8217;s head and representing Zamama.
In the fifth register is the goddess Gula
seated on a throne and accompanied by a
dog; a scorpion-man or Sagittarius;
while last of all we have the thunderbolt
of Adad over a calf, a tortoise which is
possibly an alternative emblem for Ea,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>
a scorpion, and the lamp of Nusku, the
god of fire. Finally the whole of one
side of this remarkable stele is traversed
by a gigantic serpent. Other monuments
exhibit different varieties of the
same emblems, while among those not included here,
are the club, the arrow, the sparrow and plough, the
sheaf, the vase, the bull, the goose, the man-fish, the
dove, the rod and ring (cf. Pl. <a href="#pXIVa">XIV</a>), and the coiffure
and knife of the goddess Ninkharshag, for a full and exhaustive
study of which the reader should refer to Ward,
<i>Cylinder-Seals</i>, pp. 389 ff. Of the burial customs of the
Babylonians and Assyrians, so far as they are known, we
have treated elsewhere (cf. pp. <a href="#Page_62">62</a>, <a href="#Page_69">69</a>, etc.), but it will
perhaps not be superfluous for us to briefly consider
their eschatology.</p>

<p><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 399</span></p>

<h3>(<i>E</i>) BABYLONIAN ESCHATOLOGY</h3>

<p>Man&#8217;s ideas and thoughts are very largely determined
by his environment, so too his beliefs regarding the next
world have as their material basis and setting the world in
which he now lives; the unknown but vaguely guessed
at, can only be defined, or rather depicted in terms of
the known, the unseen in terms of the seen, heaven
in the terms of earth, God in the terms of Man&#8212;in
short, the doctrine of the Incarnation underlies all religion
and all religious systems. As we have already
seen, the early Babylonians in all probability came from
the mountainous country of Elam, for they used the
same picture-sign or ideogram for both &#8220;mountain&#8221; and
&#8220;country&#8221;; the earth was therefore conceived by them
under the form of a mountain, and if this world be
shaped like a mountain, the world beyond must also
doubtless bear a similar shape, hence one of their names
for the other world was <span class="smcap">E-kur</span>, which signifies &#8220;mountain-house,&#8221;
the same name being also applied to the
present world. In the early days of Babylonian mythology,
the gods themselves were believed to inhabit
<span class="smcap">E-kur</span>, the mountain-house of the world, and it is perhaps
not unnatural to find the gods so intimately
associated with mother-earth, when one recalls that the
Babylonians believed the gods themselves to have been
evolved from the same watery chaos from which the earth
as it were emerged&#8212;the gods and the earth were children
of the same parent, and were brought into being in
the same way.</p>

<p>But this mountain-theory with regard to the other
world in no way excluded or apparently even collided
with other views of quite a different character;
indeed the most popular conception of the next
world, as the realm of the dead, was that of a hollow,
or cave situated underneath the earth, which was believed
to be shaped somewhat after the fashion of an inverted
<a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 400</span>saucer: this cave was called &#8220;Aralu,&#8221; and was
poetically described as &#8220;ir&#7779;itum la tarat&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;the land
without return&#8221;&#8212;a description which is strangely negative,
and which illustrates how little the Babylonian
concerned himself with the life after death compared
with the Egyptian, who may with some truth be said
to have devoted his attention more to the life beyond
than to the life which now is. The locality of Aralu
under the earth may also be inferred from the story of
Ishtar&#8217;s descent into Hades; this practically universal
conception is so natural a one that it hardly calls for an
explanation. The association of the realm of the dead
with the grave beneath the earth where the remains of
the dead were deposited&#8212;is almost inevitable, and the
corresponding association of the abode of the gods, or
heaven with the regions of light and brightness above
this earth&#8212;the ever-visible sun and moon being gods
themselves&#8212;is equally natural, but in passing, it must
be remarked that in the system&#8212;for lack of a better
word&#8212;which set the abode of the gods in the regions
of the sky, the heaven which they inhabited was not
accessible to mortal man, be he ever so good or virtuous;
it was apparently only in earlier times when the
home of the gods was located in or on the earth that
the souls of the departed are regarded as dwelling with
or near them.</p>

<p>This is further corroborated by the application of the
term <span class="smcap">E-kur</span>&#8212;&#8220;mountain-house&#8221;&#8212;to the earth itself
as well as to the abode of the gods and the realm
of the dead, while at the same time it was used to designate
the earthly abodes or temples of the gods; the
theory which located the home of the gods upon the <span class="smcap">E-kur</span>
is probably the earlier, and it was only in later
times, when Babylon had made herself more or less
supreme in the Euphrates valley, and had thereby gained
for her god Marduk a similar supremacy, that the circumstances
seemed to demand, as it were, a more universal
<a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 401</span>and less local home for the god whose sway thus
extended all over the country; if Marduk confines himself
to his temple-home in Babylon, how can he watch
over the fortunes and receive the homage of his devotees
all over the empire?</p>

<p>Moreover, as has been already stated, on grounds
independent of this the temptation to assign a heavenly
or sky-home to the gods has been yielded to almost
universally; this view of course did not exclude the
possibility of the god&#8217;s presence in the temples erected
to his honour, it only excluded the idea of his exclusive
presence in the temple.</p>

<p>But there were yet other names besides Aralu and
<span class="smcap">E-kur</span>, used to designate the abode of the dead, one of
which was &#8220;Shualu&#8221;; this term signifies &#8220;enquiry&#8221;
and comes from the same root as that from which the
proper name &#8220;Saul&#8221; (&#8220;asked for&#8221;) is derived, itself
being the equivalent of the Hebrew &#8220;Sheol&#8221; which the
Greeks rendered &#8220;Hades,&#8221; and English translators unfortunately
rendered &#8220;hell&#8221;; the world of the dead is
accordingly regarded as a place of enquiry, the enquiry
being presumably of the nature of an oracle. The dead
are thus supposed to be endowed with the power of
answering questions addressed to them by people on
earth; and in this capacity they resemble the gods, the
only difference being that the gods grant oracles through
the hands of their priests, while the dead use necromancers
as their mediums, as was the case when Samuel
manifested himself to Saul through the agency of the
necromancing witch of Endor. Thus in connection with
the <span class="smcap">E-kur</span> home of the gods and of the dead, it will be
observed that the dead are not only regarded as with, or
near the gods, but, like the gods they are also empowered
to assist earthly mortals with their oracular utterances;
this presupposes that the dead are endowed with a
greater knowledge than the living, and accordingly however
gloomy Aralu, Shualu or <span class="smcap">E-kur</span> (as the home of the
<a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 402</span>dead) may be, the dead are at all events drawn nearer to
the gods in this respect, and partake more freely of the
Tree of Knowledge than the living.</p>

<p>Having arrived thus far, the deification of the dead is
but a short step, which the Babylonian found no great
difficulty in taking; as however the deification of the departed
was the exception rather than the rule, the exceptional
cases of such deification must have had a special
raison d&#8217;être of their own, and that raison d&#8217;être was probably
the power of granting oracles which the Babylonian
attributed to those highly-favoured individuals, whose
heroic achievements on earth had won for them the
greatest honour accorded to mankind in antiquity. The
kings indeed were often deified after death and even
during their lifetime, but that was the natural corollary
of the belief that the next world is similar in order and
in its mode of government to this world, albeit it was
much more gloomy and also of a comparatively negative
character.</p>

<p>But though the dead are thus regarded as more akin
to the gods than the living, and more the objects of their
special care, yet their very affinity to the gods seems to
place them more beyond the power and control of the
latter, and the priests whose delegated divine authority
is paramount over the living, have no right of influence
whatever over the dead.</p>

<p>Another name for the under-world was &#8220;Ki-gallu&#8221;
which signifies &#8220;great land,&#8221; &#8220;Ki&#8221; being the regular
ideogram for &#8220;earth&#8221; generally, or &#8220;land&#8221; specifically,
the two being to the early oriental mind practically
synonymous; this term, like <span class="smcap">E-kur</span>, thus associates the
abode of the dead with the abode of the living, the abode
of the living being on the earth, and the abode of the
dead being under or within the earth. Other epithets
applied to the under-world were&#8212;&#8220;the dark dwelling,&#8221;
&#8220;the house of death,&#8221; &#8220;the grave,&#8221; &#8220;the great city,&#8221;
&#8220;the deep land,&#8221; and the above-mentioned &#8220;ir&#7779;itum
<a name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 403</span>la tarat,&#8221; &#8220;the land whence there is no return,&#8221; the
latter occurring in the well-known story of Ishtar&#8217;s
descent into Hades, where the nether-world is further
described as a house of darkness in which the dead,
clothed in feathers like birds, depend upon dust and clay
for their nourishment. This account of the world beyond
the grave tallies well with the account given by
Ea-bani, when called up from the realms of the dead
to speak to his friend Gilgamesh; Ea-bani shrinks from
paining his friend by describing the horrors of the under-world,
but is at last prevailed upon to do so, and his description
of Hades is that of &#8220;a place where the worm
devours and all is cloaked in dust&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;Dust thou art, and
unto dust shalt thou return.&#8221; The idea of the dead being
clothed with feathers like birds recalls the characteristically
Mesopotamian monsters of composite form, half-bird
and half-man, themselves apparently connected directly
or indirectly with the nether-world.</p>

<p>It was believed however that the pitiable lot of the
dead could be to some extent mitigated by acts of devotion
and charity practised by those that remain; thus it
was of primary importance to the deceased that he should
receive a respectable and decent burial, and furthermore
his needs did not stop there, for in <span class="smcap">E-kur</span>&#8212;whether the
term be applied to the earth as the home of mortals, or to
the land of the dead, man requires both food and drink
for his sustenance. The condition of the hapless man
who receives no burial and is provided with none of the
necessaries of life in the next world is described at the
close of the Gilgamesh Epic, where we are informed that
such an one is consumed by gnawing hunger and has
perforce to satisfy his appetite with the offal on the
streets; but not only was the unburied shade a curse
to himself so to speak, he also became a curse to the
living by assuming the form of an &#8220;ekimmu&#8221; or
demon, possessed with malignant intentions towards
mankind, and furthermore endowed with the regrettable
<a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 404</span>power of carrying those intentions into good
effect; it therefore behoved the living to attend to the
requirements of the dead from the point of view of self-defence
quite apart from any considerations of pious
charity.</p>

<p>There was no distinction made between the faithful
and unfaithful departed in the halls of Aralu, the only
difference there was, lay between the lot of those who
received the rites of burial and the means of sustenance
at the hands of their surviving friends and relatives, and
the lot of those to whom were denied the last rites and
offices; it should however be observed that the future
life of those who perished on the battle-field was believed
to be fraught with greater happiness, or at least less unhappiness
than that of the generality of mankind.</p>

<p>Thus to the Babylonian the sting of death was very
far from being removed, and their funeral dirges
consisted chiefly in lamentations on account of the
pitiful plight of the departed one rather than for
their own personal loss; for them there was no swallowing
up of Death in Victory, the only possibility of
future bliss lying in immunity from death, an immunity
which had only been offered to one or two mortals, and
of which only one had apparently succeeded in availing
himself, that single exception being &#7778;it-napishtim
whose exaltation to the godhead apparently exonerated
him from the necessity of dying. The prevailing note was
thus one of pessimism, a pessimism from which &#8220;the dwellers
in Mesopotamia&#8221; have never succeeded in entirely
emancipating themselves, a pessimism which is moreover
discernible in the sacred writings of the Hebrews
long after their emigration from Babylonia to the land
of Canaan. To Job the lot of a tree is preferable to that
of humanity, for &#8220;it hath hope, if it be cut down, it will
sprout again; but man lieth down and riseth not; till
the heavens be no more, they shall not awake nor be
raised out of their sleep&#8221;; so too the Psalmist begs that
<a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 405</span>he may be allowed to recover his strength&#8212;&#8220;before I go
hence and be no more,&#8221; the general inference being that
to the Hebrew mind the life beyond the grave resembled
bare existence rather than a life with positive activities
and positive functions to perform.</p>

<p>The tendency to regard the unknown with suspicion
and doubt is incidental to the laws of our nature, and history
demonstrates that only a courageous buoyancy won
through the ceaseless efforts of mankind to combat the
Mother who bore them, can overcome this as all other
tendencies inherent in human nature. To the peoples of
antiquity the world beyond was unknown and dark, for
primitive man perforce regards as dark a state of existence
concerning which he is in the dark, just as he has
invariably attributed the causes of physical phenomena
outside his ken to the powers of darkness, but the very
darkness of the other world so far from diminishing the
reality of its existence in his primitive mind, seems to
have contrariwise, intensified it; he regarded the unseen
through the medium of a mental telescope&#8212;to him it
loomed dark but big; seeing was by no means the necessary
condition of his believing, he believed where he did
not see, and his imagination proved quite adequate to the
occasion. In the twentieth century on the other hand
there is an inclination to regard the unknown as <i>ipso facto</i>
non-existent, but it must be confessed that the tendency
exhibited by early man to accredit the unknown with an
even greater reality than the known, accords more closely
with the archetypal idealism of Plato and others whose
mental development is at least of no mean order, and
whose theories have not as yet stood convicted at the
bar of Logic.</p>

<h2>A SHORT BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>

<p>Those readers who may desire to enlarge their information
on any particular subject referred to in this volume
cannot do better than consult the following works. For a
history of the excavations, Hilprecht&#8217;s <i>Explorations in Bible
Lands</i> (T. &amp; T. Clark, Edinburgh), is a most useful book.
For further details regarding the excavations at Nippur
Peters&#8217; <i>Nippur, or Explorations and Adventures on the Euphrates</i>
(Putman) should be consulted, and also Fisher&#8217;s <i>Excavations
at Nippur</i> (Philadelphia). For a study of cuneiform writing
and the inscriptions, Sayce&#8217;s <i>Archæology of the Cuneiform Inscriptions</i>
(S.P.C.K.) should be read. It is the most recent work on
the subject, is full of interest and original ideas. For the
literature of the Babylonians and Assyrians, see Harper&#8217;s
<i>Literature of the Assyrians and Babylonians</i>, (Aldine Library),
which contains the translation of a thoroughly representative
selection of the literary products of both countries.</p>

<p>An account of the excavations carried on during the last
decade by the Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft at Babylon and
Ashur will be found in the official reports of Koldewey and
Andrae in the Mitteilungen of the Society (published by J.
Hinrichs&#8217;sche, Buchhandlung Leipzig), while for a detailed
account of the Anu-Adad temple at Ashur Andrae&#8217;s <i>Der Anu-Adad
Tempel</i> (also published by Hinrichs) should be consulted.
The works of De Sarzec and Heuzey (published by
E. Leroux, Paris) should be studied by those who wish to gain
a full and comprehensive account of the excavations at Tellô;
of these the <i>Découvertes en Chaldée</i> is the most important. This
magnificently illustrated work, which contains a complete
statement of the early discoveries made on this site, and also a
critical and well-balanced judgment of the deductions which we
may make from those discoveries, is unquestionably one of the most
important contributions to the study of Sumerian art. Of M.
Heuzey&#8217;s smaller works, <i>Une Villa Royale Chaldéenne</i> (Leroux,
Paris) is calculated to be of special interest to the student of
Babylonian architecture, while his numerous articles in the
<a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a><span class="pagenum">Pg 407</span><i>Revue d&#8217;Assyriologie</i> (Leroux, Paris) and papers in the <i>Comptes
Rendus de l&#8217;Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres</i> solve many
of the problems which beset the study of oriental art. In regard
to Cylinder-seals, the monumental work which has recently
been published by W. Hayes Ward, <i>The Cylinder-Seals of
Western Asia</i> (Carnegie Institute) is by far the most comprehensive
on the subject, and is the culmination of a great many
years&#8217; research in the public and private collections of Europe
and America.</p>

<p>For the study of Law, the reader should consult C. J. Johns&#8217;
<i>Babylonian and Assyrian Laws, Contracts and Letters</i> (Edinburgh),
<i>Assyrian Deeds and Documents</i> (Cambridge), and <i>An Assyrian
Doomsday Book</i> (Delitzsch and Haupt, <i>Assyriologische Bibliothek</i>,
Band XVII, Leipzig), while the student of Babylonian and
Assyrian Religion should refer to Morris Jastrow&#8217;s <i>Religion of
Babylonia and Assyria</i> (Boston, U.S.A), which is the only exhaustive
work on the subject. For a detailed and comprehensive
treatment of the arts and crafts of the Babylonians and
Assyrians in the light of the material available when the book
was published, Perrot and Chipiez, <i>History of Art in Chaldaea
and Assyria</i> (Chapman &amp; Hall, London; A. C. Armstrong
&amp; Son, New York) should be read.</p>

<p>In regard to manners, customs and general mode of life,
reference should be made to the standard works of Maspero&#8212;<i>The
Dawn of Civilization</i>, <i>The Struggle of the Nations</i>, and <i>The
Passing of the Empires</i> (S.P.C.K., London), to the same writer&#8217;s
(Maspero) <i>Life in Ancient Egypt and Assyria</i> (Chapman &amp; Hall)
to Sayce&#8217;s <i>Assyrians and Babylonians</i> (J. C. Nimmo, London); and
to Delitzsch&#8217;s <i>Handel und Wandel in Altbabylonien</i> (Deutsche
Verlags-Anstalt, Stuttgart), while for military matters, the
reader should consult J. Hunger&#8217;s <i>Heerwesen und Kriegführung
der Assyrer</i> in <i>Der Alte Orient 1911</i>.</p>

<p>This volume does not deal with the history of the Babylonians
and Assyrians, but those interested in that branch
should read Rogers&#8217; <i>History of Babylonia and Assyria</i> (Eaton &amp;
Mains, New York; Jennings &amp; Pye, Cincinnati), Goodspeed&#8217;s
<i>A History of the Babylonians and Assyrians</i> (Smith, Elder &amp; Co.,
London); and the standard-works of Maspero&#8212;<i>The Dawn
of Civilization</i>, <i>The Struggle of the Nations and The Passing of the
Empires</i> (S.P.C.K., London) for a general history, while for the
early period King&#8217;s <i>Sumer and Akkad</i> (Chatto &amp; Windus) and
Radau&#8217;s <i>Early Babylonian History</i> (Oxford University Press)
should be studied.</p>

in Mesopotamia is in all cases to be regarded as the effect of a
general conflagration, and that in fact cremation was never practised. But
if such be the case, then the pottery buried with the burnt human remains
would similarly bear the marks of burning. In many cases the pottery
apparently affords no definite evidence for or against the theory, but
Dr. Koldewey informs me that the vessels containing the burnt remains
of human beings at Surghul, showed no trace of their having been in the
fire themselves, so here at all events we have clear and incontrovertible
evidence of the practice of cremation in Babylonia.</p></div>
